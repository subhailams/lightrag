The weights of the new, merged model  $\\theta\\_{new}$  are then computed by adding a weighted sum of these task vectors to the base model weights:  $\\theta\\_{new} = \\theta\\_{base} + \\sum\\_k \\lambda\\_k\\tau\\_k$  Here,  $\\lambda\\_k$  is a scaling parameter that determines the contribution of each task vector to the final merged model.\n\nA key problem of weight interpolation-based methods is that they neglect parameter interference, leading to performance degradation. A recent work [\\[63\\]](#page-20-3) identifies two key sources of interference: redundant parameter values and conflicting parameter signs across models, and proposes a method that addresses these issues to achieve improved merging performance. The proposed TIES-Merging method addresses information loss in existing merging methods by incorporating three steps: resetting minimal parameter changes, resolving sign conflicts, and merging only aligned parameters. The trimming of redundant parameter changes in TIES-Merging not only resulted in higher performance of merged models, but also achieved better compression for the fine-tuned parameter updates. This compression of fine-tuned weight parameter updates is further investigated in ComPEFT [\\[62\\]](#page-20-4).\n\nThe three steps of TIES-Merging are implemented as follows. In the first step, minimal parameter changes are reset by retaining only the most influential components of each task vector τ<sup>k</sup> and setting the rest to zero. This effectively removes redundant or insignificant modifications. The second step resolves sign conflicts across models by determining an aggregate sign for each parameter based on the overall direction of significant changes across all tasks. This ensures that conflicting updates do not cancel each other out. In the final step, only the aligned parameters are merged by selectively averaging the values of parameters that agree with the elected sign from the previous step, while excluding those that disagree. This selective merging process ensures that the final model incorporates only consistent and significant parameter changes from each task-specific model, thereby preserving task-relevant information while minimizing interference.\n\nAnother recent work [\\[65\\]](#page-20-5) proposes the DARE method, which goes further by zeroing out small differences between the fine-tuned model and the original base model, while amplifying the differences. In practice, DARE [\\[65\\]](#page-20-5) is often used together with Task Arithmetic [\\[27\\]](#page-19-10) or TIES-Merging [\\[63\\]](#page-20-3). Specifically, DARE operates as follows. It applies a random mask m<sup>k</sup> ∼ Bernoulli(p) to task vector τk, where p is the drop rate, and then rescales the remaining parameters:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}\\_k = \\frac{1}{1-p} \\left( (1-m\\_k) \\odot \\tau\\_k \\right). \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nThe resulting sparsified task vector τˆ<sup>k</sup> is then used to merge models. This task vector can be utilized in the aforementioned linear task arithmetic (referred to as DARE-Linear) or TIES (referred to as DARE-TIES) methods.\n\nModel merging is gaining momentum in ML research, and has been applied in areas such as multimodal model development [\\[7,](#page-18-5) [58\\]](#page-20-6) and merging experts [\\[7\\]](#page-18-5). It is also becoming popular in both the broader image generation and LLM communities, where due to the low barrier to entry, many researchers and engineers are continually merging existing models to create new customized models.\n\nIn the image generation domain, model merging techniques became widely accessible to practitioners especially after their implementation in open-source toolkits [\\[10\\]](#page-18-4). Similarly, language model merging really gained popularity after the implementation of *mergekit* [\\[21,](#page-18-0) [34\\]](#page-19-0). This toolkit provides all of the popular *recipes* for merging language models. In addition to simple linear and spherical interpolation, advanced recipes such as Task Arithmetic, TIES-Merging, DARE are also implemented, offering users the ability to experiment with combining these methods to work with fine-tunes of popular base models such as Mistral [\\[28\\]](#page-19-11). With this toolkit, a large number of capable merged models are developed by the community, and most of the top models on the Open LLM Leaderboard [\\[26\\]](#page-19-1) are gradually dominated by merged models produced by the community of language model enthusiasts.\n\nMergekit also introduced an additional method, called *Frankenmerging* which is not based on weight merging, but for the user to experiment with trying to stack different layers from multiple models to sequentially create a new model. This method has the advantage of not tying the user to one particular family of models with a fixed architecture for merging (e.g. Mistral-based models), but potentially creating *new* architectures from merging entirely different models. It is noted that discovering new *Frankenmerging* technique remains a challenge for the community, and requires much more trial and error to discover new recipes for this technique. To date, almost everyone uses a similar *Frankenmerging* merge recipe, and there has been very little trial and error to improve upon it. The field remains highly under-explored, and we believe this is where evolution can help.\n\n#### 1.1.3 Connection to Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search\n\nModel merging holds significant potential and democratizes the model-building\n######################\nOutput:"

This technique stands in contrast to traditional transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is further fine-tuned for a new task. While transfer learning offers advantages like improved performance and faster convergence, the resulting models are typically limited to single tasks. Model merging, on the other hand, strives to create a versatile and comprehensive model by combining the knowledge from multiple pre-trained models, potentially yielding a model capable of handling various tasks simultaneously.\n\nWhile fine-tuning an existing model involves training an existing model further on a specialized dataset, model merging methods work by combining existing models without any additional gradientbased training, making it very cost-effective in terms of compute requirements. Many in the machine learning community, including researchers, hackers, and hobbyists alike, are using both fine-tuning and model-merging to create the best models for their purposes. In fact, this collaborative way of developing continually improved models has parallels with the traditional open-source software development approach [\\[47\\]](#page-19-2) where the trend is for the community to develop foundational machine learning models like open source software [\\[45,](#page-19-3) [46\\]](#page-19-4).\n\nA simple method of merging multiple models is to average the weights of multiple models finetuned from the same base initial model. This *model soup* approach [\\[61\\]](#page-20-0) demonstrated significant improvements on relatively large image processing and image classification models. The work pointed to similarity between weighted model averaging leading to a flat local minima. Theoretical [\\[17,](#page-18-1) [31,](#page-19-5) [32,](#page-19-6) [44\\]](#page-19-7) and empirical studies dating back from the 1990s [\\[24,](#page-18-2) [25\\]](#page-19-8) demonstrated that flatter local optima generalize better to out-of-distribution shifts. More recent work [\\[14,](#page-18-3) [41\\]](#page-19-9) examined the theoretical properties and practical implications of weight averaging applied to larger generative models.\n\nLinear weight averaging is performed as follows. Let  $\\theta\\_1, \\theta\\_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$  represent the weight vectors of two distinct models, where d is the dimension of the weight space. The merged model's weights, denoted as  $\\theta\\_{new}$ , are computed using the following equation:  $\\theta\\_{new} = \\lambda \\theta\\_1 + (1 - \\lambda)\\theta\\_2$ . Here,  $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$  is a weighting parameter that determines the relative contribution of each model to the final merged model. By adjusting  $\\lambda$ , practitioners can control the balance between the two original models' characteristics in the resulting merged model.\n\nLinear weight averaging not only works well for image processing and classification models, but is also effective for image generation models such as latent diffusion models. The release of Stable Diffusion [\\[50\\]](#page-20-1) led to a variety of specialist fine-tunes of the model for a variety of different styles, from photorealism, to anime, to realistic painting styles. Popular open-source WebUIs [\\[10\\]](#page-18-4) enabled practitioners to experiment with merging different models using linear or spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) [\\[60\\]](#page-20-2) of weight parameters of distinct fine-tuned Stable Diffusion models. This has led to the discovery of merged models that combine strengths of specialized models into a single model. For some time, the most popular Stable Diffusion models were neither the original base models nor the fine-tuned versions, but rather the merged models created by enthusiasts.\n\n#### 1.1.2 Merging Language Models\n\nSimple weight interpolation works well for merging image generation models that operate in a real valued latent and output space, but to our surprise, they also still work for merging language models under the right conditions, but have performance issues [\\[63\\]](#page-20-3). Recently, new methods have been proposed to address merging language models specifically. One method, Task Arithmetic [\\[27\\]](#page-19-10), involves building *task vectors* by subtracting pre-trained from fine-tuned model weights, enabling manipulation through arithmetic operations to steer the merged model's behavior.\n\nTask Arithmetic operates as follows. Let  $\\theta\\_{base} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$  denote the weights of a pre-trained base model. For each task k, let  $\\theta\\_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$  represent the weights of a model fine-tuned for that specific task. The task vector  $\\tau\\_k$  for each task k is defined as the difference between the fine-tuned model weights and the base model weights:  $\\tau\\_k = \\theta\\_k - \\theta\\_{base}$ . The weights of the new, merged model  $\\theta\\_{new}$  are then computed by adding a weighted sum of these task vectors to the base model weights:  $\\theta\\_{new} = \\theta\\_{base} + \\sum\\_k \\lambda\\_k\\tau\\_k$  Here,  $\\lambda\\_k$  is a scaling parameter that determines the contribution of each\n######################\nOutput:"

While model merging has emerged as a cost-effective promising approach for creating new models by combining existing ones, it currently relies on human intuition and domain knowledge, limiting its potential. Here, we propose an evolutionary approach that overcomes this limitation by automatically discovering effective combinations of diverse open-source models, harnessing their collective intelligence without requiring extensive additional training data or compute. Our approach operates in both parameter space and data flow space, allowing for optimization beyond just the weights of the individual models. This approach even facilitates crossdomain merging, generating models like a Japanese LLM with Math reasoning capabilities. Surprisingly, our Japanese Math LLM achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of established Japanese LLM benchmarks, even surpassing models with significantly more parameters, despite not being explicitly trained for such tasks. Furthermore, a culturally-aware Japanese VLM generated through our approach demonstrates its effectiveness in describing Japanese culture-specific content, outperforming previous Japanese VLMs. This work not only contributes new state-of-the-art models back to the open-source community, but also introduces a new paradigm for automated model composition, paving the way for exploring alternative, efficient approaches to foundation model development.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nModel merging [\\[21,](#page-18-0) [34\\]](#page-19-0), a recent development in the large language model (LLM) community, presents a novel paradigm shift. By strategically combining multiple LLMs into a single architecture, this exciting development has captured the attention of researchers due to its key advantage: it requires no additional training, making it an incredibly cost-effective approach for developing new models. This accessibility has fueled a surge in interest and experimentation with model merging. The Open LLM Leaderboard [\\[26\\]](#page-19-1) is now dominated by merged models, showcasing its potential for democratizing foundation model development.\n\nHowever, model merging is considered by many to be a form of black art or alchemy, relying on the model maker's intuition and instincts about model selection and merging recipes to create and refine a new model that performs well for a particular task. Furthermore, the model maker is often required to have some domain knowledge for the various different benchmark tasks. Given the large diversity of open models and benchmarks in the community, human intuition can only go so far, and we believe a more systematic approach for discovering new model combinations will take things much further.\n\nWe believe evolutionary algorithms will be able to discover more effective model merging solutions, and thus provide a path for automating the creation of more capable models. As a step towards this direction, in this work, we show that evolution can be employed to discover novel and unintuitive ways to merge multiple models to produce new models with a new combined ability. In this work, we present a methodology that leverages evolutionary algorithms to facilitate the merging of foundation models. Our approach is distinguished by its ability to navigate both parameter space (weights) and the data flow space (inference path), proposing a framework that integrates these two dimensions.\n\nThis work makes several key contributions to the field of foundation model development:\n\n- 1. Automated Model Composition: We introduce Evolutionary Model Merge, a general evolutionary method to automatically discover effective combinations of selected models for creating new foundation models with user-specified capabilities. This approach harnesses the collective intelligence of existing open models, enabling the creation of powerful models without the need for extensive training data or compute.\n- 2. Cross-Domain Merging: We demonstrate that our method can discover novel ways to merge models from disparate domains (e.g., non-English language and Math, non-English language and Vision), potentially exceeding the capabilities achievable through conventional human design strategies.\n- 3. State-of-the-Art Performance: We showcase the effectiveness of our method by automatically generating a Japanese LLM with Math reasoning capability and a Japanese Vision-Language Model (VLM). Notably, both models achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, even without explicit optimization for those tasks.\n- 4. High Efficiency and Surprising Generalizability: We observe that our 7B parameter LLM surpasses the performance of some previous 70B parameter Japanese LLMs on benchmark datasets, highlighting the high efficiency and surprising generalization capability of our approach. We believe this model can serve as a strong general-purpose Japanese LLM.\n- 5. Culturally-Aware VLM: The generated Japanese VLM achieves top results when tested on a domestically-sourced dataset of Japanese image-description pairs, demonstrating its ability to handle Japanese culture-specific content.\n\nWe are committed to open science and are excited to open-source our EvoLLM-JP and EvoVLM-JP, two state-of-the-art Japanese foundation models, to the community, enabling further research and development in the field. Our work challenges the conventional paradigm of expensive model development by demonstrating that our evolutionary-based method can produce competitive models without relying on gradient-based training. This paves the way for exploring alternative, potentially more efficient, approaches to foundation model development.\n\n### 1.1 Background and Related Work\n\n### 1.1.1 Overview of Model Merging.\n\nModel merging offers a novel approach to leverage the strengths of multiple pre-trained models. It allows us to combine task-specific models, each potentially fine-tuned for a particular downstream task, into a single unified model.

To date, almost everyone uses a similar *Frankenmerging* merge recipe, and there has been very little trial and error to improve upon it. The field remains highly under-explored, and we believe this is where evolution can help.\n\n#### 1.1.3 Connection to Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search\n\nModel merging holds significant potential and democratizes the model-building process, making it accessible to a broad range of participants. However, it heavily relies on intuition and domain knowledge. Human intuition, however, has its limits. With the growing diversity of open models and tasks, we need a more systematic approach. We believe evolutionary algorithms, inspired by natural selection, can unlock more effective merging solutions. These algorithms can explore a vast space of possibilities, discovering novel and counter-intuitive combinations that traditional methods and human intuition might miss.\n\nIn deep learning, techniques such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS) [\\[66\\]](#page-20-7) employed evolutionary techniques to discover new architectures [\\[48,](#page-19-12) [55\\]](#page-20-8) that might be non-intuitive for human designers to discover. However, NAS-methods consumed significant computational resources given how each candidate model architecture needed to be trained. Our approach aims to *save* compute resources by discovering structures that take advantage of existing capabilities of existing Transformer blocks that had already consumed considerable resources to train in the first place.\n\nPre-trained transformer blocks are akin to neural network components one can choose to mix and match using an evolutionary architecture search algorithm. However, unlike NAS, we do not need to train the model, and can evaluate the candidates right away. In a sense, our work resonates with the goals of earlier works of morphology search such as NEAT [\\[56\\]](#page-20-9) and more recent work such as Weight Agnostic Neural Networks [\\[18\\]](#page-18-6) which evolved neural network structures with certain task-specific inductive biases, without the need to train the weight parameters using gradient descent. Similarly, this was how NAS methods such as SMASH [\\[56\\]](#page-20-9) avoided costly inner-loop training through the application of a Hypernetwork [\\[22\\]](#page-18-7) to estimate the weights of architectural candidates.\n\nRecent work in language models tried to duplicate the layers of a pre-trained Transformer many times [\\[58\\]](#page-20-6) as a starting point to pre-train a much larger network, to enable efficient training of much larger language models [\\[64\\]](#page-20-10). Similarly, in our approach, we are interested in applying automated search methods to discover the effective reuse of existing pre-trained layers.\n\nIn this work, we apply evolution to not only automate the optimization of model merging recipes in weight space, confined to a single architecture, but also explore applying evolution to optimize the stacking of layers from different models—a more involved approach that has the potential to create\n\nentirely novel neural architectures from existing building blocks. Unlike weight merging optimization which confine space of models to be merged together to fine-tuned descendents of the same parent base model, layer stacking optimization has no such constraints. Our work systematically explores the application of evolution applied in both parameter and layer space.\n\n## <span id=\"page-4-1\"></span>2 Methods\n\nOur goal is to create a unified framework capable of automatically generating a merged model from a any individual in the collection. Central to our approach is the application of evolutionary algorithms, which we employ to refine the intricacies involved in model merging. To systematically address this challenge, we first dissect the merging process into two distinct, orthogonal configuration spaces, analyzing their individual impacts. Building on this analysis, we then introduce a cohesive framework that seamlessly integrates these spaces. Figure [1](#page-4-0) provides a schematic representation of our approach. ✅ ❎ ✅\n\n✅\n\n✅\n\n✅\n\nQ2: Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. … How much will she have spent on ice cream after 60 days?\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>Figure 1: Overview of Evolutionary Model Merge. Our approach encompasses (1) evolving the weights for mixing parameters at each layer in the parameter space (PS); (2) evolving layer permutations in the data flow space (DFS); and (3) an integrated strategy that combines both methods for merging in both PS and DFS. Notice that merging in the PS is not simple copying and stitching of the layers parameters, but also mixes the weights. This merging is akin to blending colors as illustrated here (e.g., red and blue becomes purple). Note that we translated the questions to English for the reader; the models operate on Japanese text.\n\n### 2.1 Merging in the Parameter Space\n\nModel merging in the parameter space (PS) aims to integrate the weights of multiple foundational models into a unified entity with the same neural network architecture, yet outperforming the individual models. While various strategies for combining model parameters exist [\\[41,](#page-19-9) [61\\]](#page-20-0), our approach leverages task vectors analysis to understand each model's strengths, based on the specific tasks they are optimized for or excel in [\\[27\\]](#page-19-10). Specifically, we enhance TIES-Merging with DARE [\\[63,](#page-20-3) [65\\]](#page-20-5), allowing for more granular, layer-wise merging (In this paper, by \"layer\" we mean the input/output embedding layers or a transformer block). We establish merging configuration parameters for sparsification\n######################\nOutput:"

Specifically, we enhance TIES-Merging with DARE [\\[63,](#page-20-3) [65\\]](#page-20-5), allowing for more granular, layer-wise merging (In this paper, by \"layer\" we mean the input/output embedding layers or a transformer block). We establish merging configuration parameters for sparsification and weight mixing at each layer, including input and output embeddings. These configurations are then optimized using an evolutionary algorithm, such as CMA-ES [\\[23\\]](#page-18-8), for selected tasks, guided by critical task-specific metrics (e.g., accuracy for MGSM, ROUGE score for VQA).\n\n## 2.2 Merging in the Data Flow Space\n\nRecent analysis and discoveries imply that knowledge is stored distributedly in language models [\\[20,](#page-18-9) [42,](#page-19-13) [43\\]](#page-19-14), suggesting simple yet novel model merging possibilities in the data flow space (DFS). Unlike\n\nmerging in PS, model merging in DFS preserves the original weights of each layer intact. Instead, it optimizes the inference path that tokens follow as they traverse through the neural network. For example, after the i-th layer in model A, a token may be directed to the j-th layer in model B.\n\nIn our initial effort in this domain, we limit ourselves to serial connections and non-adaptive configurations, deferring the investigation of more flexible model merging to future work. Concretely, with a collection of N models and a budget T, our method searches for a sequence of layer indices L (t) i,j that delineates the path all the tokens should follow for a specific task. Here Li,j denotes the j-th layer in the i-th model, with t ∈ [1, T] marking the step in the inference path.\n\nOne can quickly imagine how large the search space is. Assuming the total number of layers across all models is  $M$ , the size of the search space is  $(M + 1)^T$ , here the extra one indicates the inclusion of a pass-through layer. Even with a modest setting of  $M = 64$  (e.g., 2 models of 32 layers each) and  $T = 60$ , this setting translates to an astronomically large search space, a challenge even for a capable evolutionary search algorithm. Luckily, our preliminary studies indicated that certain layer arrangements, particularly repetitive or permuted sequences from earlier in the model, can adversely affect performance. Based on this, we modify our settings to include an indicator array  $\\mathcal{I}$  of size  $T = M \\times r$  in the evolutionary search space, here  $r$  is number of repetitions.\n\nConceptually, we layout all the layers in sequential order (i.e., all layers in the *i*-th model followed by those in the *i* + 1-th model) and repeat them  $r$  times, the indicator array then manages the inclusion/exclusion of layers. If  $\\mathcal{I}\\_i > 0$  we include the layer corresponding to index  $i$  in the slots in the merged model, otherwise we exclude it. Consequently, our search space is reduced to  $2^T$ , which is still large, but tractable for evolutionary search.\n\nIn our search, we only optimize the data inference path inside the merged model and keep parameters in the models intact. In this setting, a layer may face an input whose distribution is different from what it is used to (from its original model), leading to unexpected outputs. For example, our preliminary studies [\\[57\\]](#page-20-11) show that swapping a pair of neighboring layers in a language model makes its performance drop. Although more theoretical studies are needed to model the distribution shift, empirically we find that appropriately scaling an input that wishes to go from layer  $i$  to  $j$  by  $W\\_{ij}$  help alleviate the problem. Here,  $W \\in R^{M \\times M}$  is a matrix that is also optimized by the evolutionary search together with the indicator array  $\\mathcal{I}$ .\n\nThe size of  $W$  grows quadratically with  $M$ , for scenarios involving a large number of layers. An alternative approach to contain the search space size involves parameterizing  $W$  with a neural network [\\[22,](#page-18-7) [51\\]](#page-20-12). We can instead evolve a feed-forward network to output the scaling weights conditioned on the layer and step indices:  $W\\_{ij} = \\pi\\_{\\theta}(i, j, t)$  where  $\\theta$ 's are the parameters to be evolved, whose size does not change when  $M$  grows.\n\n#### 2.3 Merging in Both Spaces\n\nModel merging in the PS and in the DFS are orthogonal approaches, however, it is straightforward to combine these disentangled methods and further boost the performance of a merged model. As we show in the rightmost illustration in Figure [1](#page-4-0) and in Section [3.1,](#page-6-0) it is possible to first apply PS merging to a collection of models, and then put back this merged model in the collection and apply DFS merging from this enlarged collection.\n\nThis can be extremely helpful when one considers model merging with multiple objectives, wherein PS merging can be applied first to produce several merged models each of which targets one of\n######################\nOutput:"

show in the rightmost illustration in Figure [1](#page-4-0) and in Section [3.1,](#page-6-0) it is possible to first apply PS merging to a collection of models, and then put back this merged model in the collection and apply DFS merging from this enlarged collection.\n\nThis can be extremely helpful when one considers model merging with multiple objectives, wherein PS merging can be applied first to produce several merged models each of which targets one of the muliple objectives of interest, and then DFS merging is applied with multi-objective genetic algorithms such as NSGA-II [\\[16\\]](#page-18-10) to further expand the final model's performance in relevant metrics.\n\n## 3 Results\n\nMost merged models in the community optimize for a narrow set of tasks defined in The Open LLM Leaderboard [\\[26\\]](#page-19-1). Our motivation is for evolutionary search to discover novel ways to merge different models from vastly different domains (e.g., non-English language and Math, or non-English language and Vision) which might be difficult for human experts to discover effective merging solutions themselves. Furthermore, effectively merging models from very different domains can lead to models of wider real-world applicability and enable us to develop models beyond the large population of models that are optimized for the narrow range of tasks defined by a leaderboard.\n\nWe demonstrate our Evolutionary Model Merge approach described in Section [2](#page-4-1) by evolving a Japanese LLM capable of Math reasoning, and a Japanese VLM proficient in handling culturallyspecific content. Specifically, in Section [3.1,](#page-6-0) we apply evolution to merge a Japanese LLM with an English Math LLM to build a Japanese Math LLM, and in Section [3.3,](#page-13-0) we apply evolution to merge a Japanese LLM with an English VLM to create a Japanese VLM.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-6-0\"></span>3.1 Evolving Japanese Math LLM\n\n#### 3.1.1 Experimental Setup\n\nSource Models To develop a model capable of solving math problems in Japanese, we apply evolutionary model merge on a set of source models containing a Japanese LLM and Math LLMs: shisa-gamma-7b-v1 [\\[9\\]](#page-18-11) (Japanese LLM), WizardMath-7B-V1.1 [\\[40\\]](#page-19-15) and Abel-7B-002 [\\[12\\]](#page-18-12). All these models are fine-tuned from Mistral-7B-v0.1 [\\[28\\]](#page-19-11).\n\nDataset For testing, we used the MGSM dataset [\\[52\\]](#page-20-13), a multilingual translation of a subset of the GSM8k dataset [\\[13\\]](#page-18-13). The Japanese test set of MGSM, consisting of 250 samples, was used for the final evaluation. Specifically, MGSM contains translations of the first 250 samples (ID 0-249) from the GSM8k test set. We used a different dataset for evolutionary search to avoid overfitting the test set. Specifically, we translated the remaining 1069 samples (out of 1319 examples) of the GSM8k test set that were not included in the MGSM test set into Japanese. These correspond to samples with IDs 250-1318 in the original GSM8k test set, ensuring no overlap with the MGSM Japanese test set. One may think that it is more natural to translate the GSM8k training set. However, in our preliminary efforts, this approach did not work well. Since open-source math models were trained on the GSM8k training set, we were unable to perform accurate evaluations.\n\nEvaluation We evaluated the ability to generate Japanese answers to Japanese math problems. Therefore, we considered an answer correct if it met the following criteria: (1) the concluding numerical value must be correct, and (2) the reasoning text should be written in Japanese.\n\nWe treated the last numerical value appearing in the output as the answer. We needed to adopt this heuristic because we are merging multiple models that were trained in different formats, which made it difficult to correct the output format. This method appeared to extract the answers correctly in almost all cases. Additionally, to determine the language of the output, we utilized fasttext [\\[29,](#page-19-16) [30\\]](#page-19-17). We used greedy sampling for generation and calculated the zero-shot pass@1 accuracy.\n\nOptimization For optimization in PS, we used the CMA-ES[\\[23\\]](#page-18-8) algorithm implemented in Optuna [\\[8\\]](#page-18-14) with default hyper-parameters. Specifically, we set all initial parameter values to 0.5, sigma to 1/6, and the population size to  $4 + \\lfloor 3 \\ln(n\\_{\\text{params}}) \\rfloor$ , where  $n\\_{\\text{params}}$  is the number of parameters to optimize. The fitness value is defined as the accuracy for all 1069 training samples. Please note that this set is disjoint from MGSM's test set. The optimization was conducted for 1000 trials, and the best trial with respect to the training accuracy was chosen as the final model. We decided to employ TIES-Merging [\\[63\\]](#page-20-3) with DARE [\\[65\\]](#page-20-5) through preliminary experiments, and optimized its parameters.\n\nIn our DFS merging experiments,  $M = 64$ ,  $r = 3$\n######################\nOutput:"

59.5  | 71.5 |\n\n#### 3.1.3 Analysis\n\nIn our exploration of model merging in the parameter space, we experimented with diverse configurations, such as varying the assignment of merging parameters across different layer groups. However, due to a constrained dataset, we did not witness notable improvements in performance correlating with increase in configuration complexity. Consequently, we focused our reporting on a PS merged model (Model 4 in Table [1\\)](#page-7-0) that adopts the simplest setting: considering each source model as a singular layer and allocating two DARE-TIES associated parameters to each for evolutionary merging. Figure [3](#page-9-0) illustrates the evolved parameter configuration post PS merging.\n\nThe CMA-ES optimization results reveals that all three models are important, as suggested by the uniformity of the optimized weighting values. The fact that the sum of the weights exceeds 1 and is approaching 2, is noteworthy. This suggests that a combination method which amplifies the contributions of the models, rather than a simple interpolation, proved to be more effective.\n\nThe dominant density from the Japanese LLM suggests its critical contribution to solving the task. We conjecture that this may also be partially attributed to the Japanese LM's larger amount of fine-tunings from the Mistral base model. Japanese LMs based on English models, such as Shisa-Gamma-7B-v1, are typically created through a two-step process: continued pretraining and instruction fine-tuning. The continued pretraining phase involves learning from a significantly larger dataset compared to standard fine-tuning. For instance, Shisa-Gamma-7B-v1 is based on a Japanese base model that underwent continued pretraining on 100B tokens of Japanese text. The resulting differences in weights between Shisa-Gamma-7B-v1 and the original Mistral-7B-v1 likely encapsulate more information than standard fine-tuning, making them more challenging to sparsify. In line with the discussion in [\\[65,](#page-20-5) Section 4.6], the sparsification of DARE tends to degrade performance when applied to such extensively fine-tuned models. Our evolutionary search has seemingly managed to address this issue by increasing the density for the Japanese LM.\n\nThe parameter settings derived from our PS merging experiments align well with outcomes from our DFS merging efforts. By incorporating the PS-merged model into our pool of source models and applying DFS merging across all potential pairings, we observed optimal performance with the combination of the PS-merged model and the Japanese language mode (Model 6 in Table [1\\)](#page-7-0). This finding echoes the significant influence of the Japanese language model, as indicated by its notable presence in Figure [3,](#page-9-0) and reaffirms the substantial promise of evolutionary model merging.\n\n![](_page_9_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>Figure 3: Evolved Configurations for PS merging. Although the weights are similar across the 3 source models, the pronounced density from the Japanese LLM underscores its pivotal role.\n\nFigure [4](#page-9-1) displays the evolution of the inference path, where our approach consistently recognized the value of initial steps, incorporating every layer from the first model (our PS-merged model), except for the last decoding layer and the embedding layer. As the process advanced, the method refined the selection to a smaller, more effective set of layers and strategically alternated between layers from both contributing models. Significantly, the scaling parameters  $W\\_{ij}$  emerged as crucial elements, our ablation studies revealed that eliminating them in the evolved model (e.g., by setting  $W\\_{ij} = 1$ ) led to a performance decline exceeding 20 percent, highlighting their importance in the model's efficacy.\n\n![](_page_9_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-9-1\"></span>Figure 4\n######################\nOutput:"

While the leap in performance is not as pronounced as with PS merging, it still proves to be a valid and orthogonal approach. Finally, our hybrid model (Model 6), which integrates both merging strategies, shows further enhancements on the task. The order of the source models in the indicator array  $I$  affects the performance of the DFS merging method. We conduct experiments with all possible combinations and report the best scores in Table [1,](#page-7-0) we defer detailed analysis to Sec [3.2.5.](#page-12-0)\n\nFigure [2](#page-7-1) gives an overview of the five models' \"answer sheet\" on the math problems. Our merged models retain the foundational knowledge in the source models, as evidenced by the similar score patterns on problems 1–15. Moreover, they exhibit emergent capabilities, successfully tackling problems that stumped the source models (e.g., problems 20–30). Evidently, by effectively integrating a Japanese LLM and mathematical models, we have succeeded in producing models that are proficient in both Japanese language understanding and mathematical problem-solving.\n\n![](_page_7_Figure_6.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-7-1\"></span>Figure 2: Performance Overview. The figure depicts the success of various models on the MGSM-JA task, with each of the 250 test problems represented along the x-axis by problem ID. Correct answers are indicated by colored markers at the corresponding positions.\n\nFurthermore, Table [2](#page-8-0) presents the results of evaluating the general Japanese language ability using the Japanese Language Model Evaluation Harness (JP-LMEH) benchmark suite. This benchmark suite consists of nine tasks, and the average score across these tasks is widely used as an indicator of overall Japanese language proficiency. Our models achieve remarkably high scores of 70.5 and 66.2, surpassing the source models and even the previous state-of-the-art 70B parameter Japanese LLM (specifically, Japanese StableLM 70B), despite having only 7B to 10B parameters.\n\nCompared to the source Japanese model (shisa-gamma-7b-v1), it is interesting to note that there is not only a significant improvement in the MGSM scores but also improvements in other tasks such as JSQuAD and JAQKET. However, we also acknowledge that there are certain tasks, such as JNLI and MARC (for DFS), where performance has dropped. It should be noted that the MGSM scores here do not match those in Table [1,](#page-7-0) due to the differences in evaluation protocols (few-shot, prompting, etc.). Additional details are provided in Appendix [A,](#page-21-0) including extensive comparisons with other models in Table [6.](#page-22-0)\n\nMoreover, Appendix [C](#page-21-1) showcases intriguing examples that demonstrate the utility of our models merged using evolution. The merged models correctly answered questions that require both knowledge about Japanese-culture *and* Math ability. In contrast, even if such Japanese questions were translated into English and answered in English, English math models would likely fail to provide the correct answers as they may not be aware of Japanese culture-specific context in the questions.\n\nTable 2: Breakdown of JP-LMEH Scores for Japanese Language Proficiency.

The optimization was conducted for 1000 trials, and the best trial with respect to the training accuracy was chosen as the final model. We decided to employ TIES-Merging [\\[63\\]](#page-20-3) with DARE [\\[65\\]](#page-20-5) through preliminary experiments, and optimized its parameters.\n\nIn our DFS merging experiments,  $M = 64$ ,  $r = 3$ , and consequently,  $T = M \\times r = 192$ . We kept the last 200 examples in the training data as our validation set and optimize on the rest of the data with a batch size of 200. We report the performance of the snapshot that achieved the highest accuracy in the validation set, and the test set is strictly isolated from the optimization process. We adopted CMA-ES in EvoJAX [\\[59\\]](#page-20-14), it optimized  $I$  and  $W$  for a total of 100 generations with a popluation size of 128, and we used the default hyper-parameters. We limited our DFS merging to two models A and B to ensure that the final model remains modest in size and can be run on a single GPU, but in principle, the methodology can scale to merging multiple models. During the merging, model A's tokenizer, and input/output embeddings are utilized. Furthermore, to maintain compatibility with the embedding layers, we mandate that the initial and final transformer layers of model A define the start and the end of the inference path. We initialized the indicator array  $I$  so that all layers in model A are more likely to be included as initial hops in the inference path to shorten the search time.\n\n#### 3.1.2 Experimental Results\n\nTable [1](#page-7-0) summarizes the performance of the LLMs on Japanese Math and overall Japanese benchmark tasks.

The order of the source models in the indicator array  $I$  affects the performance of the DFS merging method. We conduct experiments with all possible combinations and report the best scores\n######################\nOutput:"

Similarly, for the DFS baseline equivalent (Frankenmerging), we used the same combination of source models as in our DFS experiments, enabling direct comparisons.\n\nThe results indicate that TIES-Merge and Frankenmerging led to decreased performance in both MGSM-JA and JP-LMEH, suggesting unsuccessful merging. Notably, Frankenmerging resulted in a MGSM-JA score of 0, which is consistent with its general tendency to often produce models that fail to generate meaningful outputs. DARE-TIES performed relatively better among these baselines, with a slight improvement in MGSM-JA compared to the source models. However, our PS model significantly outperformed all these baselines, and the hybrid merging method (PS+DFS) gives the best test performance on the target task.\n\n### 3.2.2 Comparison with Fine-tuning\n\nTable [3](#page-10-0) also compares our evolutionary model merging approach with the fine-tuning method. To ensure a fair comparison, we used the identical dataset. Specifically, we utilized the 1069 samples of Japanese-translated GSM8k that were employed in our PS and DFS optimization for fine-tuning the models. We tested learning rates of 1e-5, 5e-5, and 1e-4, choosing the optimal one. We set the number of epochs to 3 and tried both LoRA and full parameter fine-tuning. We experimented with all three source models: shisa-gamma-7b-v1, WizardMath-7B-V1.1, and Abel-7B-002.\n\nThe MGSM-JA scores show that while fine-tuning generally improved performance over the original models, the highest score achieved was 43.2. This is notably lower than our proposed method, which exceeded a score of 50. Additionally, unlike our approach, fine-tuning often led to significant decreases in JP-LMEH scores. This suggests that fine-tuning may be more data-hungry and prone to catastrophic forgetting issues.\n\nOther potential fine-tuning baselines. Another potential fine-tuning baseline would be combining all data used by all source models to fine-tune a base model. However, this approach is often impractical in general settings, and in our specific case, it is indeed impossible to implement for comparison. We elaborate on these points below. Our proposed approach's strength lies in its ability to freely combine openly published models from platforms like HuggingFace. However, model publishers often only release the models themselves, not the training datasets or detailed\n\ntraining methods, as these are considered proprietary knowledge. For instance, the training data for WizardMath-7B-V1.1 and Abel-7B-002 is not publicly available. shisa-gamma-7b-v1 is a further fine-tuned version of japanese-stablelm-base-gamma-7b (which is Mistral-7B-v0.1 fine-tuned for Japanese), and the data used for training japanese-stablelm-base-gamma-7b is also not public. Moreover, the Japanese fine-tuning for japanese-stablelm-base-gamma-7b involved 100B tokens, indicating a substantial computational cost (such as more than 10,000 GPU hours). Therefore, a comparison with this approach is not feasible. It is also worth noting that such fine-tuning would require careful tuning of dataset mixing ratios, which is non-trivial and costly.\n\n#### 3.2.3 Impact of Manual Model Selection\n\nIn our main experiments, we manually selected three source models. To assess the broader applicability of our approach, it is useful to investigate how sensitive the method is to the selection of source models. To this end, we conducted experiments to measure the distraction effect of including irrelevant models, which simulate the scenario where suboptimal models are inadvertently selected.\n\nTo investigate the sensitivity of our method to source model selection, we conducted experiments to measure the distraction effect of including irrelevant models. In addition to our original seed models (shisa-gamma-7b-v1, WizardMath-7B-V1.1, Abel-7B-002), we experimented with one, two, four, and eight irrelevant models, and performed PS experiments to examine the impact on performance. The irrelevant models, chosen for their lack of relation to Japanese or mathematics, were: leo-mistral-hessianai-7b (German), lince-mistral-7b-it-es (Spanish), Mistral-7B-v0.3-Chinese-Chat (Chinese), BioMistral-7B (biomedical domain), Claire-Mistral-7B-0.1 (French), komt-mistral-7b-v1 (Korean), Mistral-7B-v0.1-arabic (Arabic), and Loquace-7B-Mistral (Italy). All these models are openly available on HuggingFace.\n\nWe slightly modified the PS optimization by adding weight normalization, which became necessary due to the increased number of models (up to 11 in total). This modification explains why the \"+0 irrelevant model\" result does not exactly match our original PS result.\n\nThe results, shown in the \"Distraction\" part of Table [3,](#page-10-0) are generally favorable. As expected, using only the initial three models yielded the best results. However, the performance degradation when adding irrelevant models was limited, especially up to four additional models, and even with 8 additional models, the performance did not collapse. This demonstrates that our optimization method is relatively robust to manual source model selection. Due to the huge GPU memory requirement at inference time, the distraction experiments were not conducted for the DFS merging method. We instead present behavior analysis and ablation studies on the topic in the following sections.\n\n### 3.2.4 Scaling to Larger Models\n######################\nOutput:"

This \"sub-optimal\" behavior is a trade-off between flexibility and search efficiency. In our experiments, we initialize the indicator array  $\\mathcal{I}$  with zeros, but set the values of those corresponding to layers in model A in the first repetition at  $2\\sigma$  where  $\\sigma$  is the initial standard deviation of CMA-ES exploration (recall that in DFS, layers from model A come before those from model B in each repetition). In this way, the merged model behaves just like model A at the beginning of the DFS process, and is allowed to gradually add/remove layers if necessary. Comparing with the other scenario where we initialize I with only zeros, this setting effectively avoids the cases where poor stacking of the layers causes the LLM to output complete nonsense and waste explorations, at the cost of losing the flexibility to automatically swap the order of models in  $\\mathcal{I}$ .\n\nIn our second ablation study, the difference between models #6 and #7 highlights the importance of the inclusion of the scaling matrix  $W$ . Without scaling, the performance of model #6 is even worse than the PS-merged model, one of its source models. Sufficient as it is in this setting, we wish to point out that this simple scaling treatment does not work if any of the source models has been fine-tuned for a significantly longer time. We suspect that prolonged fine-tuning might lead to increased incompatibility for data traversing through layers from different models. This could be due to permutations in the weight matrices. For example, assuming we are organizing the 4096 dimensions of the hidden states by their absolute values, data from layer 1 in model A might look like (1, 2, ... 4096), but in model B, after extended fine-tuning, it might appear as (4001, 133, 3, ... 989) vs (1.1, 1.9, ..., 4097) when it was only slightly fine-tuned.\n\nWhile it is hard to understand thoroughly why DFS merging helped improve performance, we conducted analysis of the merged model (model #5 in Table [4\\)](#page-12-1) to get insights. Figure [5](#page-13-1) shows the final hops and scales configuration from the merged model. It is important to notice that we forced the scaling factor  $W\\_{i,j} = 1$  if  $j = i + 1$  and layers  $i, j$  are from the same model. This is to prevent the possibility of introducing extra modeling power via  $W$ , in this manner we are certain that all the performance boost comes from layer stacking and permutation. It is interesting and surprising to notice that the DFS-merged model decides to skip layer #30 from MetaMath-13B-V1.0 at the beginning of the inference path. Based on this finding, we removed layer #30 from MetaMath-13B-V1.0, and without any further modifications we found the performance increased to 10%. This implies that DFS merging works because it is able to identify the redundant/harmful operations (with respect to a specific task) embedded in certain layers, and performance increases once these layers are removed.\n\n![](_page_13_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\n<span id=\"page-13-1\"></span>Figure 5: Evolved Configurations from A DFS-merged 13B model. The style and settings of this plot is identical to that of Figure [4.](#page-9-1) Surprisingly, DFS decides to skip layer #30 from the original model (model #2 in Table [4\\)](#page-12-1). If we simply excluded that layer from model #2 and without any further modifications, its performance on MGSM-JA would have increased to 10%. This configuration is from model #5 in Table [4.](#page-12-1)\n\nFurthermore, we analyzed the problems where our DFS-merged model answered correctly while the math source model didn't, and we identify mainly two scenarios where DFS helped improve the performance, see Figure [6](#page-13-2) for illustrations from these scenarios. In the first scenario, we found that the English math model was able to reason correctly. However, it outputs the reasoning steps or answers in English, violating the request that the response must be written in Japanese. In this scenario, DFS-merging managed to shift the output tokens' distribution toward Japanese vocabularies, fixing the problem. In the second scenario, the English math model was actually reasoning in Japanese. But due to the error in understanding the Japanese problem or in the reasoning, it was not able to give correct answers. DFS-merging, due to its appending of the layers from the Japanese general model, was able to largely avoid the problem. Unlike the \"subtraction\" it did previously, these scenarios suggest DFS also works because it is capable of \"addition\" – finding what is missing in one of the source models and compensate that by adding layers in the inference path from other models.\n\n| Scenario 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Scenario 2                                                                                                                                                                       | Scenario 2 (EN Translation)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 以下に、あるタスクを説明する指示があります。リクエストを適切に完了するための<br>回答を日本語で記述してください。一歩一歩考えましょう。                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 以下に、あるタスクを説明する指示があります。リクエストを適切に完了するための<br>回答を日本語で記述してください。一歩一歩考え\n######################\nOutput:"

However, the performance degradation when adding irrelevant models was limited, especially up to four additional models, and even with 8 additional models, the performance did not collapse. This demonstrates that our optimization method is relatively robust to manual source model selection. Due to the huge GPU memory requirement at inference time, the distraction experiments were not conducted for the DFS merging method. We instead present behavior analysis and ablation studies on the topic in the following sections.\n\n### 3.2.4 Scaling to Larger Models\n\nFinally, we demonstrate our proposed methods also work with larger models. Concretely, we used fine-tuned versions of Llama-2-13b: ELYZA-japanese-Llama-2-13b-instruct as the Japanese general model and MetaMath-13B-V1.0 as the English math model. All other settings remained identical to the 7B experiments. Due to the limited availability of suitable 13B models, we could only select two source models.\n\nThe results are shown in Table [4.](#page-12-1) Similar to the 7B case, the MGSM-JA score significantly improved over both source models. This consistent behavior at the 13B size demonstrates the scalability of our evolutionary model merging approach.\n\nThe 7B models achieved higher MGSM-JA scores (52.0, 36.4, 55.2) than the 13B models (31.2, 23.2, 34.0) for (PS, DFS, PS+DFS). This difference is attributed to the source models rather than our proposed method. Mistral-7B-v0.1 is known to outperform Llama-2-13b in performance, especially in basic mathematical abilities, despite its smaller size. This is reflected in the performance of math-specialized models: WizardMath-7B-V1.1 scores 83.2 on GSM8k (an English math benchmark), while MetaMath-13B-V1.0 scores 72.3. This difference explains the performance gap in Japanese math abilities between our merged 7B and 13B models.\n\nOn the other hand, our DFS and PS+DFS models (models #4 and #7) achieved higher JP-LMEH average scores than ELYZA-japanese-Llama-2-13b-instruct, the Japanese general model. In general, the qualitative behavior on JP-LMEH is consistent between 7B and 13B models. Both sets\n\n<span id=\"page-12-1\"></span>\n\n| # | Model                               | Type       | Size | MGSM-JA (acc) | JP-LMEH (acc) |\n|---|-------------------------------------|------------|------|---------------|---------------|\n| 0 | Llama-2-13b                         | EN general | 13B  | 2.8           | 54.1          |\n| 1 | ELYZA-japanese-Llama-2-13b-instruct | JA general | 13B  | 13.2          | 60.2          |\n| 2 | MetaMath-13B-V1.0                   | EN math    | 13B  | 8.0           | 48.7          |\n| 3 | Ours (PS)                           | 1 + 2      | 13B  | 31.2          | 59.7          |\n| 4 | Ours (DFS)                          | 1 + 2      | 19B  | 12.8          | 61.1          |\n| 5 | Ours (DFS)                          | 2 + 1      | 21B  | 23.2          | 46.6          |\n| 6 | Ours (PS+DFS w/o W)                 | 3 + 1      | 19B  | 26.4          | 58.1          |\n| 7 | Ours (PS+DFS)                       | 3 + 1      | 21B  | 34.0          | 60.4          |\n\nTable 4: Scaling to 13B Models with ablation studies on DFS merging. Performance comparison and ablation study results on MGSM-JA and JP-LMEH tasks. Rows in gray are ablation studies.\n\nof results show improvements in JSQuAD, JAQKET, and MGSM scores, with slight decreases in JNLI and MARC compared to the original Japanese model, indicating similar trends in task-specific score changes (see Table [6\\)](#page-22-0).\n\n#### <span id=\"page-12-0\"></span>3.2.5 Analysis on DFS Merging\n\nWe included the results from two ablation studies for DFS merging in Table [4,](#page-12-1) and we wish to get insights as to how and why DFS works.\n\nComparing models #4 and #5, we show that the order of the source models in DFS merging plays a critical role. Specifically, if we put the layers from the English math model in front of those from the Japanese general model in the indicator array  $\\mathcal{I}$  (model #4), the accuracy drops by more than 10 points than the case where the layers orders are reversed (model #5). This \"sub-optimal\" behavior is a trade-off between flexibility and search efficiency. In our experiments, we initialize the indicator array  $\\mathcal{I}$  with zeros, but set the values of those corresponding to layers in model A in the first repetition at  $2\\sigma$  where  $\\sigma$  is the initial standard deviation of CMA-ES exploration (recall that in DFS, layers from model A come before those from\n######################\nOutput:"

DFS merged model improves performance on MGSM-JA mainly by shifting the output tokens' distribution to favor Japanese (scenario 1) and helping the LLM better understand the problem (scenario 2). We show the raw outputs from models #2 and #5 in Table [4,](#page-12-1) but have added/removed redundant lines for the purpose of visualization.\n\n#### <span id=\"page-13-0\"></span>3.3 Evolving Japanese VLM\n\n#### 3.3.1 Multi-modality Extension\n\nWe now extend our method to multi-modal models, and evolve a culturally-specific content aware Japanese VLM. VLMs have recently shown remarkable progress by applying the powerful instructionfollowing capabilities of pre-trained LLMs. The architecture of a VLM generally consists of three components: (1) A vision encoder to extract image features; (2) An LLM to generate text (for the purpose of describing an image); and (3) A projection network to map image features into the LLM's\n\nembedding space [\\[11,](#page-18-15) [15,](#page-18-16) [35,](#page-19-18) [37,](#page-19-19) [39\\]](#page-19-20). Crucially, the LLM component is initialized with powerful pre-trained LLMs for their text generation capabilities. During training, the projection network and optionally the LLM are trained on various vision-language datasets, while the vision encoder is fixed.\n\n#### 3.3.2 Experimental Setup\n\nSource Models The LLM component inside a VLM can be regarded as a standalone LLM, with the extra capability of understanding visual *soft prompts*. From this perspective, by fixing the vision encoder and the projection network and only focusing on the LLM component, it is straightforward to apply the methodologies detailed in Section [2](#page-4-1) to produce a new LLM with expanded capabilities.\n\nIn this experiment, we merge a Japanese LLM and the LLM component in a VLM in the parameter space. We select shisa-gamma-7b-v1 [\\[9\\]](#page-18-11) as the Japanese LLM and LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B [\\[38\\]](#page-19-21) as the VLM. Both models are fine-tunes of the Mistral-7B-v0.1 [\\[28\\]](#page-19-11) base model.\n\nDataset To the best of our knowledge, publically accessible Japanese VLM datasets are scarce. In response, we created a new open Japanese VLM benchmark and assessed our VLM on a widely recognized Japanese VQA dataset. Our new benchmark dataset consists of:\n\n- JA-VG-VQA-500: A 500-sample test set extracted from the Japanese Visual Genome VQA dataset [\\[53\\]](#page-20-15).\n- JA-VLM-Bench-In-the-Wild: A Japanese version of LLaVA-Bench-In-the-Wild [\\[39\\]](#page-19-20) . We compiled a rich collection of 42 images, accompanied by a total of 50 questions, featuring a variety of Japanese cultural elements and objects found in Japan. The QAs were crafted with the assistance of GPT-4V [\\[1\\]](#page-18-17) and underwent a human-in-the-loop filtering process to eliminate nonsensical outcomes. Compared to the JA-VG-VQA-500 dataset, our set poses more complex challenges, demanding more nuanced and detailed responses.\n\nWe used another subset of the Japanese Visual Genome VQA dataset during the evolutionary search. This subset is not overlapped with examples in the JA-VG-VQA-500 dataset, to avoid leakage in the optimization process.\n\nThe images in the JA-VLM-Bench-In-the-Wild dataset, which predominantly represent Japanese content, were carefully selected by native Japanese speakers to minimize the risk of insensitive or biased representations. All images were sourced from Unsplash and are published under the Unsplash license, which ensures that there are no ethical or legal issues with their use. Unsplash contributors agree to obtain necessary permissions from related individuals in their photos before uploading, which addresses potential concerns regarding the use of images containing recognizable humans. Additionally, the captions were generated using GPT-4-V and were meticulously reviewed by human annotators to ensure accuracy and cultural sensitivity. This process aims to create a dataset that is both ethically sourced and culturally appropriate.\n\nEvaluation We consider two baselines in our experiments: LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B [\\[38\\]](#\n######################\nOutput:"

Surprisingly, we find that both models achieve state-of-the-art results on several LLM and Vision benchmarks, while not being explicitly optimized to be good at these benchmarks, attaining the top performance on a vast array of other Japanese LLM benchmarks, even exceeding the performance of some previous SOTA 70B parameter Japanese LLMs.\n\nWith these promising initial results, we believe we are just scratching the surface of unlocking the full capabilities of evolutionary model merging, and this is the inception of a long-term development of applying evolutionary principles to foundation model development.\n\nCurrently, we are already achieving promising results in applying evolutionary model merging to image diffusion models, enabling the creation of high performance cross-domain image generation models by merging existing building blocks in novel ways discovered by evolution.\n\nThe method currently requires the user to select a set of source models to use as ingredients for evolutionary search. We believe it is also possible to leverage evolution to search for candidate source models from a vast population of existing models as well. In addition to model selection, we are also exploring using evolution to produce swarms of diverse foundation models each with\n\nits own niche and behaviors. This holds the potential of enabling the emergence of a collective intelligence consisting of a swarm of models capable of self-improvement by continuously producing new complementary internal models of the world through interaction.\n\nRelated to our work is an experiment, called Automerger [\\[33\\]](#page-19-22), released at around the same time as this work. This interesting experiment works by selecting two random models from the top 20 models on the Open LLM Leaderboard [\\[26\\]](#page-19-1) and randomly apply SLERP [\\[60\\]](#page-20-2) or DARE-TIES [\\[63,](#page-20-3) [65\\]](#page-20-5) to create new models. Over time, some of these models will do well, or even better on the benchmark tasks that define this leaderboard, becoming part of the leaderboard. We predict this approach will lead to combinations of the merged models that overfit to the benchmark tasks defined on the leaderboard. The author acknowledged that the idea behind this project was less about creating better models, but more about getting more metrics to help derive a more principled approach to model merging.\n\nOur work takes an orthogonal approach of optimizing for tasks outside of the domain specified by the original leaderboard [\\[26\\]](#page-19-1), rather than being confined by it. As we have shown, surprisingly, stepping away from optimizing for a particular benchmark occasionally results in even greater generalization to numerous other benchmark tasks that we had not intended to optimize for, and such emergent generalization might be the key to unlocking the next great advancements in AI.\n\nThe ability to evolve new models with new emergent capabilities, from a large variety of existing, diverse models with various capabilities have important implications. With the rising costs and resource requirement for training foundation models, by leveraging the rich variety of foundation models in the rich open-source ecosystem, large institutions or governments may consider the cheaper evolutionary approach for developing proof-of-concept prototype models quickly, before committing substantial capital or tapping into the nation's resources to develop entirely custom models from scratch, if that is even needed at all.\n\nFurther Applications and Impact. After the release of the preprint version of this paper, researchers have explored evolutionary model merging in different domains, highlighting the method's versatility and effectiveness. A notable example is EvoSDXL [\\[2\\]](#page-18-18), which applied evolutionary model merging to diffusion image generation models. This proves that our method works well not just for LLMs and VLMs, but for other types of models as well. Moreover, what makes EvoSDXL particularly interesting is its success in merging SDXL-Lightning [\\[36\\]](#page-19-23) with other standard SDXL fine-tunes. SDXL-Lightning is a specialized variant of SDXL that employs an adversarial loss during training, enabling rapid image generation in just a few steps, compared to the 50 or 100 steps typically required by standard diffusion models. The evolutionary model merging technique effectively combined this unique model with conventional SDXL fine-tunes, despite the different protocols used in their development. This success illustrates that our method is capable of integrating models created through varying protocols, combining their strengths to create more robust and powerful models. Additionally, other unique models such as EvoVLM-JP-v2 [\\[4\\]](#page-18-19) and EvoUkiyoe [\\[3\\]](#page-18-20) have also been developed using evolutionary model merging, further demonstrating the method's potential and adaptability. Moreover, after the publication of the preprint, evolutionary model merging was implemented in two famous open-source software packages, MergeKit [\\[21\\]](#page-18-0) and Optuna Hub [\\[8\\]](#page-18-14). It has become widely available to many people, is being used practically, and further possibilities are being explored.\n\nLimitations. We acknowledge that although our evolutionary model merging effectively integrates diverse expertise from the source models, it also inherits their limitations. For instance, we encountered instances where the merged models produced responses that lacked logical coherence. Additionally, this study does not encompass instruction fine-tuning or alignment, raising the potential for the models to yield outputs that may be factually flawed.\n\nAuthor Contributions.

We acknowledge that although our evolutionary model merging effectively integrates diverse expertise from the source models, it also inherits their limitations. For instance, we encountered instances where the merged models produced responses that lacked logical coherence. Additionally, this study does not encompass instruction fine-tuning or alignment, raising the potential for the models to yield outputs that may be factually flawed.\n\nAuthor Contributions. Takuya Akiba initiated the \"Evolutionary Optimization of Model Merging Recipes\" project, wrote the project design document, and initiated the parameter space model merging experiments, laying the groundwork for the methodology. Makoto Shing expanded the parameter space model merging to encompass vision-language models and diffusion models. Yujin Tang directed the efforts in data flow space model merging by incorporating ideas and methods inspired from the neural architecture search and morphology evolution literature, establishing foundational methods in this domain and in hybrid merging strategies. Qi Sun contributed to the implementation of our parameter space model merging framework and assisted in model evaluation. David Ha provided overarching guidance for the research project, offering technical insight, advice, feedback and writing. Ethical and Societal Impact. Evolutionary model merging offers significant positive societal impacts by enabling the creation of small yet highly capable models at lower costs. This approach democratizes access to advanced AI capabilities, potentially reducing the environmental footprint of AI development and deployment. By efficiently combining existing models, it can lead to more accessible and versatile AI solutions, particularly benefiting regions and languages with limited resources. However, as with other model development techniques, this approach may present certain considerations. The combination of diverse models could potentially lead to unexpected behaviors or biases, and the complexity of merged models might affect their interpretability. While these challenges are common in AI development, they underscore the importance of continued research and evaluation. It's worth noting that the models and techniques presented in this work serve primarily as a proof of concept. For applications in mission-critical scenarios or models intended for wide public use, further verification and refinement of the methodology may be necessary. This ongoing improvement process is crucial for realizing the full potential of evolutionary model merging while ensuring responsible and ethical deployment.\n\n## Data Availability Statement\n\nAll datasets used in this paper are publicly available.

Additionally, the captions were generated using GPT-4-V and were meticulously reviewed by human annotators to ensure accuracy and cultural sensitivity. This process aims to create a dataset that is both ethically sourced and culturally appropriate.\n\nEvaluation We consider two baselines in our experiments: LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B [\\[38\\]](#page-19-21), one of our source models, and Japanese Stable VLM [\\[54\\]](#page-20-16) a Japanese VLM trained from scratch on Japanese datasets.\n\nAll models adopt the same generation configurations, with deterministic decoding. We compute ROUGE-L with a Japanese language detector to replace non-Japanese responses with empty texts, resulting in a score of zero for non-Japanese responses. To be consistent with our LLM experiments in Section [3.1,](#page-6-0) we also employed fasttext [\\[29,](#page-19-16) [30\\]](#page-19-17) for this language detection task. However, we made an exception for cases where the ground-truth answer itself contains non-Japanese but commonly seen words in Japanese texts (e.g., a widely recognized acronym such as \"UFO\"). In these instances, non-Japanese responses from models are not converted to empty texts.\n\nOptimization We use the identical settings as the earlier LLM merging experiments in Section [3.1.](#page-6-0) Concretely, we use TIES-Merging with DARE for merging the source models in the parameter space. For merging in the data flow space, we treat LlaVa 1.6 Mistral 7B as our model A and shisa-gamma-7b-v1 as model B. For PS+DFS, our PS-merged model is model A and shisa-gamma-7b-v1 is model B.\n\n### 3.3.3 Experimental Results\n\nTable [5](#page-15-0) compares the performance of our VLM with the baselines. Please note that the Japanese Stable VLM cannot be evaluated on JA-VG-VQA-500 because it was trained on this dataset.\n\nOur merged VLMs' enhanced performance on the JA-VG-VQA-500 benchmark indicates their proficiency in Japanese, highlighting the successful integration of the source Japanese LLM with the LLM component of the original VLM through evolutionary merging. Consistent with the findings we show in the previous discussions, simple merging without evolutionary search do not give strong performance as ours, see the last 3 rows in Table [5.](#page-15-0) Furthermore, our models' superior results on the JA-VLM-Bench-In-the-Wild compared to both baselines exhibits its adeptness at navigating culturally-specific content.\n\nBesides the quantitative results in Table [5,](#page-15-0) we qualitatively compare our VLM with the baseline models in Appendix [C.](#page-21-1) Our evolved model is able to handle Japanese culture-specific content remarkably well, generally producing more detailed responses with correct information.\n\nTable 5: Performance Comparison of the VLMs. LLaVA 1.6 Mistral 7B is the source VLM and Japanese Stable VLM is an open-sourced Japanese VLM. While JA-VG-VQA-500 measures general VQA abilities in Japanese, JA-VLM-Bench-In-the-Wild evaluates the model's handling of complex VQA tasks within Japanese cultural contexts.\n\n<span id=\"page-15-0\"></span>\n\n| Model                | Size | JA-VG-VQA-500<br>(ROUGE-L ↑) | JA-VLM-Bench-In-the-Wild<br>(ROUGE-L ↑) |\n|----------------------|------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| LLaVA 1.6 Mistral 7B | 8B   | 14.3                         | 41.1                                    |\n| Japanese Stable VLM  | 8B   | -                            | 40.5                                    |\n| Ours (PS)            | 8B   | 19.7                         | 51.2                                    |\n| Ours (DFS)           | 12B  | 16.8                         | 46.5                                    |\n| Ours (PS+DFS)        | 11B  | 20.4                         | 47.6                                    |\n| TIES [63]            | 8B   | 16.0                         | 46.5                                    |\n| DARE-TIES [65]       | 8B   | 9.4                          | 36.0                                    |\n| Passthrough [21]     | 9B   | 7.3                          | 26.7                                    |\n\n## 4 Discussion\n\nIn this report, we propose a general method that uses evolutionary techniques to efficiently discover the best ways to combine different models from the vast ocean of different open-source models with diverse capabilities. By working with the vast collective intelligence of existing open models, our method is able to automatically create new foundation models with desired capabilities specified by the user. We find that our approach is able to automatically discover novel ways to merge different models from vastly different domains (e.g., non-English language and Math, or non-English language and Vision), in non-trivial ways that might be difficult for human experts to discover themselves.\n\nTo test our approach, we apply our method to automatically create a Japanese LLM capable of Math reasoning, and a culturally-specific content aware Japanese VLM. Surprisingly, we find that both models achieve state-of-the-art results on several LLM and Vision benchmarks, while not being explicitly optimized\n######################\nOutput:"

This configuration is widely used and compatible with the results on their report [\\[5\\]](#page-18-23) and Rinna leaderboards [\\[49\\]](#page-20-17), thus allowing direct comparison of scores with a large number of Japanese LLMs.\n\nTable [6](#page-22-0) is the full version of Table [2,](#page-8-0) allowing for comparisons between our models and a wider range of models. Some of the numbers are from the Stability AI Japan report and the Rinna leaderboard.

However, some of the models uses, in particular, WizardMath-7B-V1.1 [\\[40\\]](#page-19-15) has been released under a Non-Commercial, Research-only, Microsoft License, which is not *truly* open-source. Therefore, our release of EvoLLM-JP is also released under a Non-Commercial, Research-only License to be consistent with the WizardMath-7B-V1.1 model.\n\nAs researchers who benefited from the open-source community, we would like for models that we release to also be under an open-source license. In the spirit of open-source, and to showcase the applicability of our method to tackle even challenging issues like model licenses. We have ran a similar experiment where we incorporated *only* models that have been released under a true opensource license, such as MIT or Apache 2.0, and have produced a similar performing model called EvoLLM-JP-A, which we will release under Apache 2.0. This model will also be released on our GitHub: <https://github.com/SakanaAI/>.\n\nSpecifically, our EvoLLM-JP-A is a merge of shisa-gamma-7b-v1, Arithmo2-Mistral-7B, and Abel-7B-002, all of which are under MIT or Apache 2.0 License. The MGSM-JA score measured using the protocol described in Section [3.1](#page-6-0) is 52.4, and the Japanese Language Model Evaluation Harness score is 69.0. We have included results of this Apache 2.0-licensed model for comparison in Table [6,](#page-22-0) which provides a more comprehensive comparison than Table [2](#page-8-0) in the main text.\n\n## <span id=\"page-21-1\"></span>C Case Study\n\nTable [7](#page-24-0) provides an example of responses to a mathematical question by existing models and our model. By merging a Japanese language model, we not only improve our capability to understand and use Japanese in reading and writing but also expand our knowledge about Japan. This example requires both mathematical reasoning and Japanese-specific knowledge, specifically that Setsubun is the day before the beginning of spring (Risshun). Notably, only our merged model provides the correct answer. Even when the question is translated into English, the English math model WizardMath-7B-V1.1 fails to answer correctly, demonstrating that our merged model is superior to a combination of machine translation and an English math model.\n\nIt is worth noting that in Table [7,](#page-24-0) we also provide the answer from the general-purpose math model WizardMath-7B-V1.1 with the question translated into English. However, even with the translated question, WizardMath-7B-V1.1 fails to provide the correct answer. This highlights the fact that simply translating the question is not sufficient to solve the problem, as it also requires an understanding of the Japanese cultural context. Even if one were to consider a combination of machine translation and an English math model as an alternative approach, it would still fall short in capturing the nuances and context-specific knowledge required to answer the question correctly. This demonstrates the unique value of our merged model, which effectively combines mathematical reasoning capabilities with Japanese language understanding and cultural knowledge.\n\nTable 6: Breakdown of JP-LMEH Scores for Japanese Language Proficiency (Full Version of Table [2\\)](#page-8-0).

set. The problem involved calculating the internal volume of boxes. When presented in Japanese, all models encountered difficulties in correctly accounting for the wall thickness. EvoLLM-JP-v1-7B attempted to adjust for it but made an arithmetic error, leading to an incorrect volume of 351 cubic inches. shisa-gamma-7b-v1 ignored the wall thickness entirely, calculating the external dimensions only, and thus arrived at 360 cubic inches. WizardMath-7B-V1.1 recognized the need for an adjustment but applied it incorrectly, resulting in 288 cubic inches. Notably, when the original English problem was presented to WizardMath-7B-V1.1, it produced the correct answer of 72 cubic inches. This suggests that there may still be some loss in transferring the model's high mathematical reasoning abilities from English to Japanese.\n\nAdditionally, Table [9](#page-26-0) provides the case studies for our VLM. We observe that our VLM successfully obtained knowledge, cultural understanding, and fluency in Japanese expression of the Japanese LLM.\n\nThe first example features a photo of Koi-nobori, a cultural tradition specific to Japan. LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B, lacking sufficient knowledge of Japanese culture, failed to answer Koinobori correctly. In contrast, both Japanese-Stable-VLM and EvoVLM-JP, possessing knowledge of Japanese culture, successfully identified the Koi-nobori. Notably, EvoVLM-JP's response demonstrates greater fluency in its explanation.\n\nThe third example involves a question about the color of traffic lights. In Japan, the green traffic light is called \"blue\" because historically, the word \"blue\" referred to a range of colors, including blue and green, and also because the initial traffic lights used in Japan had a bluish-green hue, leading to the continuation of this terminology today. EvoVLM-JP is the only model that correctly identifies the traffic light color as \"blue\" in Japanese, demonstrating its accurate understanding of this cultural and linguistic nuance. LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B consistently but incorrectly labels the light as \"green\" in Japanese, revealing its lack of specific cultural knowledge. Japanese-Stable-VLM shows inconsistent responses, alternating between \"green,\" \"green and white,\" and \"white,\" indicating confusion. These results highlight EvoVLM-JP's superior grasp of Japanese language conventions and cultural context in this specific scenario.\n\nTable 7: Case Study of EvoLLM-JP-v1-7B. This study presents the responses of the LLMs to a problem that demands both Japanese-specific knowledge and mathematical reasoning.\n\n<span id=\"page-24-0\"></span>\n\n|                                      | Problem                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |  |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|\n| JA Instruction                       | 去年の立春は2月3日でした。今年の立春は2月4日です。去年の節分の月、去年の節分の<br>日、今年の節分の月、今年の節分の日を足し合わせると、いくつになりますか?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |  |\n| EN Instruction                       | Last year, Risshun was on February 3rd.

The volume of a box is calculated by multiplying its length,<br>width, and height. In this case, the dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. So, the<br>volume of one box is 5 inches * 6 inches * 4 inches = 120 cubic inches.<br>Step 2: Calculate the total volume of all boxes. John has 3 boxes, so the total volume of all boxes is 3<br>boxes * 120 cubic inches/box = 360 cubic inches.<br>Step 3: Adjust for the thickness of the walls. The walls of the boxes add an extra inch to each dimension,<br>so we need to subtract the volume of the walls from the total volume of the boxes. The volume of the<br>walls of one box is 1 inch * 6 inches * 4 inches = 24 cubic inches. Since there are 3 boxes, the total<br>volume of the walls is 3 boxes * 24 cubic inches/box = 72 cubic inches.<br>Step 4: Subtract the volume of the walls from the total volume of the boxes. The adjusted total volume<br>of the boxes is 360 cubic inches - 72 cubic inches = 288 cubic inches.<br>So, the total volume of the contents of the 3 boxes is 288 cubic inches.<br>The answer is: 288 cubic inches.                                                                                                                                                     |  |\n| WizardMath-7B-V1.1<br>EN Instruction | John has 3 boxes.

What is the<br>total inner volume of all 3 boxes?<br>### Response: Let's think step by step.First, we need to find the inner dimensions of one box. Since the<br>walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side of the<br>wall).<br>The original dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. So, the inner dimensions will<br>be:<br>- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches - Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches - Height: 4 inches - 2<br>inches = 2 inches<br>Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions:<br>Inner Volume = Length × Width × Height Inner Volume = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches Inner<br>Volume = 24 cubic inches<br>Since John has 3 boxes, we need to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:<br>Total Inner Volume = Inner Volume of one box × Number of boxes Total Inner Volume = 24 cubic<br>inches × 3 Total Inner Volume = 72 cubic inches<br>So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.<br>The answer is: 72.                                                                                                                                                                               |  |\n\nTable 8: Case Study of EvoLLM-JP-v1-7B.

Abstract\n\nModel merging integrates the parameters of multiple models into a unified model, combining their diverse capabilities. Existing model merging methods are often constrained by fixed parameter merging ratios. In this study, we propose Mixup Model Merge (M<sup>3</sup>), an innovative approach inspired by the Mixup data augmentation technique. This method merges the parameters of two large language models (LLMs) by randomly generating linear interpolation ratios, allowing for a more flexible and comprehensive exploration of the parameter space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed M<sup>3</sup> method in merging fine-tuned LLMs: (1) it significantly improves performance across multiple tasks, (2) it enhances LLMs' out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness and adversarial robustness, (3) it achieves superior results when combined with sparsification techniques such as DARE, and (4) it offers a simple yet efficient solution that does not require additional computational resources. In conclusion, M<sup>3</sup> is a simple yet effective model merging method that significantly enhances the performance of the merged model by randomly generating contribution ratios for two fine-tuned LLMs. The code is available at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/MixupModelMerge) [MLGroupJLU/MixupModelMerge](https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/MixupModelMerge).\n\n### 1 Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the emergence of large language models (LLMs) [\\(Brown et al.,](#page-8-0) [2020;](#page-8-0) [Touvron et al.,](#page-9-0) [2023;](#page-9-0) [OpenAI,](#page-9-1) [2023;](#page-9-1) [Chowdhery et al.,](#page-8-1) [2023\\)](#page-8-1) represents a revolutionary breakthrough.

However, SFT requires substantial computational resources and long training times [\\(Brown](#page-8-0) [et al.,](#page-8-0) [2020;](#page-8-0) [Chang et al.,](#page-8-6) [2024a\\)](#page-8-6). To address this\n\n<sup>\\*</sup>Corresponding authors\n\nchallenge, Model Merging has emerged as an efficient solution, fusing the parameters of multiple fine-tuned LLMs into a unified model with diverse capabilities, without the need for additional training or computational costs [\\(Yang et al.,](#page-10-2) [2024;](#page-10-2) [Ak](#page-8-7)[iba et al.,](#page-8-7) [2024\\)](#page-8-7). It effectively reduces the resourceintensive demands of SFT while preserving and even enhancing model performance.\n\nA simple analogy for model merging is the Super Mario game, where the protagonist gains special abilities by absorbing power-up items. Similarly, merging model parameters integrates the strengths of different models, enabling more effective multi-task learning [\\(Yu et al.,](#page-10-3) [2024\\)](#page-10-3). However, existing model merging methods have some limitations, these methods heavily rely on predefined or heuristic parameter fusion strategies [\\(Wortsman](#page-9-4) [et al.,](#page-9-4) [2022;](#page-9-4) [Ilharco et al.,](#page-9-5) [2022;](#page-9-5) [Matena and Raf](#page-9-6)[fel,](#page-9-6) [2022;](#page-9-6) [Jin et al.,](#page-9-7) [2022;](#page-9-7) [Yadav et al.,](#page-10-4) [2023;](#page-10-4) [Yu](#page-10-3) [et al.,](#page-10-3) [2024\\)](#page-10-3) such that they fail to fully explore the parameter space, thereby restricting the potential of the merged model.\n\nTo address this issue, we draw inspiration from Mixup [\\(Zhang,](#page-10-5) [2017\\)](#page-10-5) and propose a novel technique called Mixup Model Merge (M<sup>3</sup>). This method introduces randomness by dynamically adjusting the contribution ratios between models, making the model merging process more flexible and enabling a thorough exploration of the parameter space. M<sup>3</sup> further unlocks the potential of model merging, significantly enhancing the generalization performance of the merged model while improving its out-of-distribution (OOD) and adversarial robustness [\\(Wang et al.,](#page-9-8) [2023;](#page-9-8) [Zhu et al.,](#page-10-6) [2023\\)](#page-10-6). As shown in Figure [2,](#page-2-0) the implementation of M<sup>3</sup> is similar to the process of proportionally mixing magical potions in *Harry Potter*. Specifically, this method dynamically controls the parameter fusion ratio between two fine-tuned LLMs by randomly generating a linear interpolation ratio  $\\lambda\\_m$ , where  $\\lambda\\_m \\in (0, 1)$  and  $\\lambda\\_m \\sim Beta(\\alpha, \\alpha)$ . By adjusting the parameter  $\\alpha$ , we can precisely control the distribution of  $\\lambda\\_m$ , allowing M<sup>3</sup> to explore the parameter space of model merging more deeply and thus fully unleash the potential of the models, leading to improved overall performance.\n\nWe conducted extensive experiments with three fine-tuned LLMs: WizardLM-13B [\\(Xu et al.,](#page-10-7) [2024\\)](#page-10-7), WizardMath-13B [\\(Luo et al.,](#page-9-9) [2023\\)](#page-9-9), and llama-2-13b-code-alpaca [\\(Chaudhary,](#page-8-8) [2023\\)](#page-8-8), which specialize in instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation, respec-\n\ntively. Inspired by Mixup's effectiveness in enhancing the robustness of neural networks when handling corrupted labels or adversarial examples [\\(Zhang,](#page-10-5) [2017\\)](#page-10-5), we further performed comprehensive evaluations on LiveBench [\\(White et al.,](#page-9-10) [2024\\)](#page-9-10) and PromptBench [\\(Zhu et al.,](#page-10-8) [2024\\)](#page-10-8) to validate the potential of M<sup>3</sup> in improving the OOD robustness and adversarial robustness of merged models. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed M<sup>3</sup> method can significantly improve merged models' performance across\n######################\nOutput:"

Task arithmetic [\\(Ilharco et al.,](#page-9-5) [2022\\)](#page-9-5) leverages task vectors for model merging through arithmetic operations, incorporating a predefined scaling term to weight the contribution of different models. Fisher Merging [\\(Matena and Raffel,](#page-9-6) [2022\\)](#page-9-6) performs parameter fusion by applying weights derived from the Fisher information matrix [\\(Fisher,](#page-8-9) [1922\\)](#page-8-9), resulting in more precise parameter integration. TIES-Merging [\\(Yadav et al.,](#page-10-4) [2023\\)](#page-10-4) addresses task conflicts by removing low-magnitude parameters, resolving sign disagreements, and merging only the parameters that align with the final agreed-upon sign. In [\\(Yu et al.,](#page-10-3) [2024\\)](#page-10-3), it is found that LLMs can enhance their capabilities through model merging. Additionally, it introduces DARE, a method for sparsifying the delta parameters of the model [\\(Ilharco et al.,](#page-9-5) [2022\\)](#page-9-5), significantly improving the performance of various model merging techniques.\n\nMixup Mixup is proposed to enhance the generalization ability of deep learning models by surpassing traditional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) [\\(Zhang,](#page-10-5) [2017\\)](#page-10-5). It is a simple, data-agnostic augmentation technique that trains models using virtual examples created by linearly interpolating pairs of random examples and their corresponding labels.

Inspired by Mixup, we propose a novel model merging method, M<sup>3</sup>, which generates the parameters of the merged model by performing linear interpolation between the parameters of two fine-tuned LLMs, with the interpolation ratio being random.\n\n### 3 Methodology\n\n#### 3.1 Model Merging Problem\n\nFollowing [Yu et al.](#page-10-3) [\\(2024\\)](#page-10-3), we focus on merging fine-tuned LLMs that have been optimized from the same pre-trained backbone [\\(Touvron et al.,](#page-9-0) [2023\\)](#page-9-0). Specifically, we aim to fuse the parameters of these LLMs to create a unified model capable of handling multiple tasks. In this context, we restrict our attention to the merging of two models, as the mixup theory, which forms the basis of our approach, is generally applied to two entities.\n\nGiven two tasks  $t1$  and  $t2$  with the corresponding fine-tuned LLMs having parameters  $\\theta$ <sup>t1</sup>SFT and  $\\theta$ <sup>t2</sup>SFT, model merging aims to combine the parameters of these two models into a single model with parameters  $\\theta$ M. The resulting model should be able to effectively perform both tasks simultaneously, leveraging the knowledge learned from each individual model.\n\n#### 3.2 Mixup Model Merge\n\nInspired by Mixup [\\(Zhang,](#page-10-5) [2017\\)](#page-10-5), we propose a simple yet effective model merging method called Mixup Model Merge (M<sup>3</sup>). Unlike existing methods that use fixed merging ratios, M<sup>3</sup> generates the model contribution ratio randomly, harnessing randomness to inject fresh vitality into the model merging process. Specifically, M<sup>3</sup> further explores the parameter space of the merged model to unlock the potential of model merging.\n\nTo further elaborate, given two fine-tuned LLMs with parameters { $\\theta^{t\\_1}\\_{SFT}$ ,  $\\theta^{t\\_2}\\_{SFT}$ }, we combine M<sup>3</sup> with established model merging methods to fuse these parameters and obtain a single merged model with parameters  $\\theta\\_M$ . As illustrative examples, we consider two widely used merging methods: Average Merging [\\(Wortsman et al.,](#page-9-4) [2022\\)](#page-9-4) and Task Arithmetic [\\(Ilharco et al.,](#page-9-5) [2022\\)](#page-9-5).\n\nThe official computation process for Average Merging is described as follows:\n\n$$\\theta\\_M = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\theta\\_{\\text{SFT}}^{t\\_1} + \\theta\\_{\\text{SFT}}^{t\\_2} \\right) \\tag{2}$$\n\nThe official computation process for Task Arith-\n\nmetic is:\n\n$$\\begin{split} \\theta\\_M &= \\theta\\_{\\text{PRE}} + \\lambda \\cdot (\\delta^{t\\_1} + \\delta^{t\\_2}) \\\\ &= \\theta\\_{\\text{PRE}} + \\lambda \\cdot \\sum\\_{i=1}^{2} (\\theta\\_{\\text{SFT}}^{t\\_i} - \\theta\\_{\\text{PRE}}), \\end{split} \\tag{3}$$\n\nwhere  $\\theta\\_{PRE} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$  represents the parameters of the pre-trained language model (PLM), such as Llama 2 [\\(Touvron et al.,](#page-9-0) [2023\\)](#page-9-0). λ is a scaling factor that weights the contribution of each model during the merging process.  $\\delta^{t\\_i}$  denotes the delta parameter [\\(Ilharco et al.,](#page-9-5) [2022\\)](#page-9-5), which is defined as the difference between the parameters of the language models (LMs) before and after SFT, i.e.,  $\\delta^t = \\theta^t\\_{SFT} - \\theta\\_{PRE} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ , where t refers to task t.\n\nWhen introducing M<sup>3</sup>, the process for Average Merging is reformulated as:\n\n$$\n\\theta\\_M = \\lambda\n######################\nOutput:"

\\theta\\_{PRE} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ , where t refers to task t.\n\nWhen introducing M<sup>3</sup>, the process for Average Merging is reformulated as:\n\n$$\n\\theta\\_M = \\lambda\\_m \\theta\\_{\\rm SFT}^{t\\_1} + (1 - \\lambda\\_m) \\theta\\_{\\rm SFT}^{t\\_2}, \\qquad (4)\n$$\n\nwhile the process for Task Arithmetic is reformulated as:\n\n$$\n\\theta\\_M = \\theta\\_{\\text{PRE}} + \\lambda\\_m \\delta^{t\\_1} + (1 - \\lambda\\_m) \\delta^{t\\_2}, \\quad (5)\n$$\n\nwhere  $\\lambda\\_m$  determines the linear interpolation ratio between the two fine-tuned LLMs, and is generally a value between 0 and 1.  $\\lambda\\_m$  is sampled from a Beta distribution, typically  $\\lambda\\_m \\sim Beta(\\alpha, \\alpha)$ , where  $\\alpha$  controls the shape of the Beta distribution.\n\nThe hyperparameter  $\\alpha$  for M<sup>3</sup> is selected from the range [0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5]. As shown in Figure [3:](#page-3-0) (1) When  $\\alpha = 1$ ,  $\\lambda$  follows a uniform distribution, meaning all values within the range (0, 1) are equally likely to be sampled. (2) When  $\\alpha < 1$ , the distribution of λ exhibits a bimodal shape, with higher probabilities near the extremes (0 and 1). This indicates that the merged model is more likely to be dominated by one of the two models. (3) When  $\\alpha > 1$ , the distribution of  $\\lambda$  becomes concentrated around the middle (e.g., 0.5), resulting in more balanced contributions from both models.\n\n#### 3.3 Theoretical Analysis\n\nMixup performs linear interpolations between data samples and their labels in the data space [\\(Zhang,](#page-10-5) [2017\\)](#page-10-5). Similarly, M<sup>3</sup> can be viewed as applying random linear interpolation in the parameter space, where the interpolation occurs between the parameters of two fine-tuned models trained on different tasks. M<sup>3</sup> represents a natural extension of the Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) principle [\\(Chapelle et al.,](#page-8-10) [2000\\)](#page-8-10) into the model parameter\n\n<span id=\"page-3-0\"></span>![](_page_3_Figure_11.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3: The Beta distribution visualization for different α values.\n\nspace. In data space, VRM introduces a vicinal distribution to simulate the true data distribution, thereby increasing the diversity of training data and enhancing the model's generalization ability. Similarly, M<sup>3</sup> extends this principle by constructing a virtual neighborhood in the model parameter space between two task-specific models, combining their knowledge in a way that is more natural and balanced.\n\nIn the context of model merging, interpolating between two sets of model parameters,  $\\theta^{t\\_1}\\_{SFT}$  and  $\\theta^{t\\_2}\\_{SFT}$ , defines a new neighborhood distribution in the parameter space, which can be expressed as:\n\n$$\\begin{split} P\\_{\\nu}(\\theta\\_M) &= \\int \\nu(\\theta\\_M \\mid \\theta\\_{\\text{SFT}}^{t\\_1}, \\theta\\_{\\text{SFT}}^{t\\_2}) \\, d\\theta\\_M \\\\ &\\times P(\\theta\\_{\\text{SFT}}^{t\\_1}) P(\\theta\\_{\\text{SFT}}^{t\\_2}), \\end{split} \\tag{6}$$\n\nwhere  $P\\_{\\nu}(\\theta\\_M)$  represents the probability distribution of the new model parameters  $\\theta\\_M$  generated through interpolation. The function  $\\nu(\\theta\\_M |$   $\\theta^{t\\_1}\\_{SFT}, \\theta^{t\\_2}\\_{SFT})$  defines the range and behavior of  $\\theta\\_M$ , depending on the interpolation strategy (such as linear interpolation). Additionally,  $P(\\theta^{t\\_1}\\_{SFT})$  and  $P(\\theta^{t\\_2}\\_{SFT})$  represent the prior distributions of the parameters of the two models, respectively.\n\nUnder the linear interpolation strategy, the function  $\\nu(\\theta\\_M | \\theta\\_{SFT}^{t\\_1}, \\theta\\_{SFT}^{t\\_2})$  is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\theta\\_M = \\lambda\\_m \\cdot \\theta\\_{\\text{SFT}}^{t\\_1} + (1 - \\lambda\\_m) \\cdot \\theta\\_{\\text{SFT}}^{t\\_2}, \\qquad (7)\n$$\n\nwhere\n######################\nOutput:"

More details of these LLMs and datasets can be found in Appendix [A.1.](#page-10-9)\n\nThe Benchmarks for evaluating Out-of-Distribution and Adversarial Robustness To assess OOD robustness, we evaluate math & code, LM & math, and LM & code models using instruction following (LiveBench-Instruction), coding (LiveBench-Coding), and language comprehension (LiveBench-TypoFixing) category in LiveBench [\\(White et al.,](#page-9-10) [2024\\)](#page-9-10), respectively. More details on OOD benchmarks are given in Appendix [A.3.](#page-11-0)\n\nWe utilize the Adversarial Prompt Attacks module in PromptBench [\\(Zhu et al.,](#page-10-8) [2024\\)](#page-10-8) to assess the robustness of LLMs against adversarial prompts. Specifically, we employ three attack methods: DeepWordBug (character-level) [\\(Gao](#page-8-16) [et al.,](#page-8-16) [2018\\)](#page-8-16), BERTAttack (word-level) [\\(Li et al.,](#page-9-16) [2020\\)](#page-9-16), and StressTest (sentence-level) [\\(Naik et al.,](#page-9-17) [2018\\)](#page-9-17). The evaluation is conducted on two datasets supported by PromptBench: SST2 (sentiment analysis) [\\(Socher et al.,](#page-9-18) [2013\\)](#page-9-18) and CoLA (grammatical correctness) [\\(Warstadt,](#page-9-19) [2019\\)](#page-9-19). For more details on PromptBench and attack methods, please refer to Appendix [A.4.](#page-12-0)\n\nEvaluation Metrics We calculate win rate for AlpacaEval and LiveBench-Instruction, zeroshot accuracy for GSM8K and MATH, pass@1 for HumanEval, MBPP and LiveBench-Coding, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for CoLA, accuracy for SST2, and zero-shot accuracy for LiveBench-TypoFixing.\n\nImplementation Details Unless otherwise specified, the details of the model merging experiments are consistent with [Yu et al.](#page-10-3) [\\(2024\\)](#page-10-3). The hyperparameter  $\\alpha$  for M<sup>3</sup> is chosen from the range [0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5]. For a detailed description of the hyperparameter settings in model merging methods, please refer to Appendix [A.2.](#page-11-1) Additionally, all experiments are conducted on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs.\n\n#### 4.2 Merging Task-Specific Fine-Tuned LLMs\n\nWe integrate M<sup>3</sup> into three prominent model merging techniques: Average Merging, Task Arithmetic, and TIES-Merging. The performance of merging task-specific fine-tuned LLMs is presented in Table [1.](#page-6-0)\n\nFrom Table [1,](#page-6-0) we obtain the following observations: 1) M<sup>3</sup> generally enhances Average Merging, Task Arithmetic, and TIES-Merging when merging fine-tuned LLMs. For example, the improvements achieved by Average Merging with M<sup>3</sup> for Math & Code are 7.43% on GSM8K, 3.74% on Math, and 11.0% on MBPP. For LM & Code, Average Merging with M<sup>3</sup> shows improvements of 7.31% on AlpacaEval, 7.32% on HumanEval, and 2.4% on MBPP. Task Arithmetic with M<sup>3</sup> results in improvements of 2.0% on AlpacaEval and 2.44% on HumanEval for LM & Code, and 10.4% on MBPP for Math & Code. TIES-Merging with M<sup>3</sup> achieves an improvement of 4.01% for LM & Math on GSM8K. For LM & Code, TIES-Merging with M<sup>3</sup> shows significant improvements of 3.11% on AlpacaEval, 25.61% on HumanEval, and 30.8% on MBPP. 2) Compared to Task Arithmetic, Average Merging and TIES-Merging tend to benefit more from M<sup>3</sup>. This is because both Average Merging and TIES-Merging use a fixed merging ratio of 1/2, whereas Task Arithmetic allows the merging ratio to vary within the range [0.5, 1.0]. Consequently, the randomness introduced by M<sup>3</sup> in the merging ratio has a more pronounced impact on Average Merging. This further highlights the critical role of an effective merging ratio in determining the performance of the merged model. 3) [Yu et al.](#page-10-3) [\\(2024\\)](#page-10-3) has indicated that the suboptimal results of merging WizardMath-13B with llama-2-13b-codealpaca are due\n######################\nOutput:"

By using this linear interpolation method, the parameters  $\\theta\\_{SFT}^{t\\_1}$  and  $\\theta\\_{SFT}^{t\\_2}$  are combined in the parameter space, forming a new neighborhood distribution  $P\\_{\\nu}(\\theta\\_M)$ . This process effectively merges the knowledge of both models into a unified parameter space, thus achieving robust performance across different tasks while maintaining the original strengths of the models.\n\nBy interpolating the parameters, M<sup>3</sup> encourages the model to learn smoother decision boundaries. In this context, smoother decision boundaries can be understood as the boundaries between different tasks, such as instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation, where the model must understand and adapt to each task differently. In tasks  $t\\_1$  and  $t\\_2$ , M<sup>3</sup> creates a virtual neighborhood that seamlessly integrates knowledge from both tasks. This approach prevents the merged model from overfitting task-specific details, ensuring a balanced and effective performance across all tasks.\n\nSecondly, M<sup>3</sup> introduces a linear inductive bias in the parameter space, encouraging the merged model parameters to lie on a linear manifold between the two source models. This linear structure offers significant advantages in terms of simplicity and generalization. According to Occam's Razor, simpler solutions tend to generalize better. By performing linear interpolation between two sets of parameters, M<sup>3</sup> avoids unnecessary complexity in the model merging process, leading to a more straightforward and efficient solution.\n\nThirdly, M<sup>3</sup> can improve the performance of the merged model across multiple tasks by mitigating task conflicts. Different tasks may require conflicting parameter values, which can lead to performance degradation on one task while optimizing for another. Linear interpolation helps balance these conflicts, resulting in a model that performs well among all tasks.\n\n### 4 Experiments\n\n#### 4.1 Experimental Setup\n\nTask-Specific Fine-Tuned LLMs and Datasets Following the experimental setup given in [Yu](#page-10-3) [et al.](#page-10-3) [\\(2024\\)](#page-10-3), we select three task-specific finetuned LLMs: WizardLM-13B [\\(Xu et al.,](#page-10-7) [2024\\)](#page-10-7), WizardMath-13B [\\(Luo et al.,](#page-9-9) [2023\\)](#page-9-9), and llama-2- 13b-code-alpaca [\\(Chaudhary,](#page-8-8) [2023\\)](#page-8-8), all of which\n\nuse Llama-2-13b [\\(Touvron et al.,](#page-9-0) [2023\\)](#page-9-0) as the pretrained backbone.

This further highlights the critical role of an effective merging ratio in determining the performance of the merged model. 3) [Yu et al.](#page-10-3) [\\(2024\\)](#page-10-3) has indicated that the suboptimal results of merging WizardMath-13B with llama-2-13b-codealpaca are due to llama-2-13b-code-alpaca not being well fine-tuned for code generation. In this context, the proposed M<sup>3</sup> approach improves the pass@1 score on MBPP by 10.4% for the merged model of WizardMath-13B and llama-2-13b-codealpaca. The improvement demonstrates that when one of the fine-tuned models to be merged is not well fine-tuned for the specific task, M<sup>3</sup> can effectively unlock the potential of both models, maximizing the performance of the merged model. The M<sup>3</sup> approach helps mitigate the impact of suboptimal fine-tuning on model merging performance.\n\n#### 4.3 Model Robustness\n\n<span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>![](_page_5_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4: Performance of merged models (Math & Code, LM & Math, and LM & Code) using three model merging methods (Average Merging, Task Arithmetic, and TIES-Merging) on OOD datasets.\n\nOut-of-distribution robustness To ensure that the evaluation datasets are as representative as possible of OOD data, we select datasets with sufficiently recent release dates and ensure they cover domains that fine-tuned LLMs have not been specifically trained on. Consequently, Math & Code is evaluated on LiveBench-Instruction, LM & Math on LiveBench-Coding, and LM & Code on LiveBench-TypoFixing. The performance of the merged LLMs is shown in Figure [4.](#page-5-0) As illustrated in Figure [4,](#page-5-0) M<sup>3</sup> consistently enhances the performance of merged models—Math & Code, LM & Math, and LM & Code—on OOD datasets. Specifically, when Task Arithmetic is combined with M<sup>3</sup>, the Math & Code model demonstrates a 1.9% improvement in win rate on LiveBench-Instruction, the LM & Math model achieves a 1.6% increase in pass@1 on LiveBench-Coding, and the LM & Code model shows a significant 6% boost in accuracy on LiveBench-TypoFixing. Similarly, when Average Merging is combined with M<sup>3</sup>, the Math & Code model attains a 1.5% improvement in win rate on LiveBench-Instruction, the LM & Math model achieves a 0.7% increase\n\n<span id=\"page-6-0\"></span>\n\n| Merging<br>Methods | Models             | Use Model<br>Mixup | Use<br>DARE | Instruction<br>Following | Mathematical<br>Reasoning |       | Code Generating |       |\n|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|-------|-----------------|-------|\n|                    |                    |                    |             | AlpacaEval               | GSM8K                     | MATH  | HumanEval       | MBPP  |\n| /                  | LM                 | No                 | No          | 45.14                    | 2.20                      | 0.04  | 36.59           | 34.00 |\n|                    | Math               | No                 | No          | /                        | 64.22                     | 14.02 | /               | /     |\n|                    | Code               | No                 | No          | /                        | /                         | /     | 23.78           | 27.60 |\n|                    |                    | No                 | No          | 45.28                    | 66.34                     | 13.40 | /               | /     |\n|                    | LM<br>& Math       | Yes                | No          | 44.40                    | 66.26                     | 13.80 | /               | /     |\n|                    |                    | No                 | Yes         | 44.22                    | 66.57                     | 12.96 | /               | /     |\n|                    |                    | Yes                | Yes         | 43.53                    | 66.57                     | 14.12 | /               | /     |\n|                    | Average<br>Merging |                    | No          | No                       | 36.60                     | /     | /               | 29.88 |\n|                    |                    | LM<br>& Code       | Yes         | No                       | 43.91                     | /     | /               | 37.20 |\n|                    |                    |                    | No          | Yes                      | 38.81                     | /     | /               | 31.71 |\n|                    |                    | Yes                | Yes         | 40.31                    | /                         | /     | 36.59           | 37.00 |\n|                    |                    | No                 | No          | /                        | 56.17                     | 10.28 | 8.53            | 8.20  |\n|                    | Math<br>& Code     | Yes                | No          | /                        | 63.61                     | 14.02 | 8.54            | 19.20 |\n|                    |                    | No                 | Yes         | /                        | 56.18\n######################\nOutput:"

CoLA Datasets when Executing StressTest prompt attack method. The best and secondbest results are marked in bold and underlined fonts.\n\nby 15.75% on CoLA. Furthermore, in most cases, M<sup>3</sup> not only improves the adversarial robustness of the merged models but also enhances their performance metrics (accuracy and MCC) on the SST2 and CoLA datasets. Specifically, with M<sup>3</sup>, Math & Code demonstrates a 28.56% increase in accuracy on SST2 and a 26.18% increase in MCC on CoLA, while LM & Code achieves a 62.62% increase in accuracy on SST2. These results show that M<sup>3</sup> effectively enhances both the adversarial robustness and the performance of the merged models in sentiment analysis and grammar correctness tasks. Detailed experimental results for the remaining Prompt Attack Methods (DeepWordBug and BERTAttack) are presented in Appendix [B.](#page-12-1)\n\n#### 4.4 Mixup Model Merge with DARE\n\nDARE is a model sparsification method proposed by [\\(Yu et al.,](#page-10-3) [2024\\)](#page-10-3), with a more detailed introduction provided in Appendix [E.](#page-14-1) We combine M<sup>3</sup> and DARE with three model merging techniques, including Average Merging, Task Arithmetic, and TIES-Merging, to compare the effects of M<sup>3</sup> and DARE individually and explore their combined impact. The experimental results are presented in Table [1.](#page-6-0) Additionally, in the DARE method, the drop rate hyperparameter is set to 0.2.\n\nFrom Table [1,](#page-6-0) we conclude that: 1) In most cases,\n\nM<sup>3</sup> outperforms DARE, with a particularly significant advantage on certain datasets. For instance, the Math & Code model achieves a pass@1 score of 9.8% on the MBPP dataset when combined with DARE, while this score increases to 19% when combined with M<sup>3</sup>. This demonstrates that M<sup>3</sup> unlocks new potential in model merging by randomly generating merging ratios, leading to performance improvements that surpass those achieved by DARE. 2) Combining DARE and M<sup>3</sup> generally results in better model merging performance. For example, the LM & Math and LM & Code models, enhanced by TIES-Merging with M<sup>3</sup> and DARE, achieve the best performance on the test datasets. While only incorporating TIES-Merging with M<sup>3</sup> to these models, the enhanced models achieve the second best performance. This suggests that M<sup>3</sup> and DARE can complement each other. Moreover, in some cases, M<sup>3</sup> alone can deliver the best results, while DARE alone only achieves the best performance in very few cases, further demonstrating the superiority of M<sup>3</sup>.\n\n### 5 Conclusion\n\nInspired by the mixup method and the Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) principle, we propose Mixup Model Merge (M<sup>3</sup>), a novel approach for merging fine-tuned LLMs by introducing randomness into the parameters linear interpolation process. Unlike traditional methods such as average merging and task arithmetic, M<sup>3</sup> leverages a Beta distribution to dynamically adjust the merging ratio, enabling more flexible exploration of the parameter space. Experimental results demonstrate that M<sup>3</sup> not only significantly enhances the performance of the merged model across various tasks but also improves its OOD and adversarial robustness. Furthermore, when combined with sparsification techniques such as DARE, our approach achieves even more favorable model merging outcomes. In summary, M<sup>3</sup> is a simple yet powerful technique that requires minimal computational resources. By merely adjusting the merging ratio, it produces a merged model with enhanced task-specific capabilities and robustness. This exciting discovery paves the way for further research into optimizing merging ratio selection in model merging processes.\n\n### 6 Limitations\n\nThere are several limitations of the M<sup>3</sup> method: While it performs well for merging two models, (1) its scalability when merging a larger number of models, especially those with significant differences, remains uncertain. Additionally, (2) due to the inherent randomness in the merging process, multiple attempts may be required to achieve a merged model that meets expectations. This unpredictability can lead to increased computational costs, particularly in large-scale applications, resulting in a significant rise in resource consumption. Finally, (3) Our method may also be extended to a wider range of applications, such as merging fine-tuned models with Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) [\\(Ouyang et al.,](#page-9-20) [2022\\)](#page-9-20) models to reduce the alignment tax [\\(FINE-](#page-8-17)[TUNING\\)](#page-8-17).\n\n### References\n\n- <span id=\"\n######################\nOutput:"

For example, with M<sup>3</sup>, the PDR of Math & Code decreased by 3.2% on the SST2 dataset and by 92.12% on the CoLA dataset, while the PDR of LM & Code decreased by 30.36% on SST2 and\n\n<span id=\"page-7-0\"></span>\n\n| Model             | Dataset | Use<br>Mixup    | Use<br>Attack | Metric<br>(%) | PDR<br>(%)   |\n|-------------------|---------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Math<br>&<br>Code | SST2    | No              | No            | 57.68         | 38.97        |\n|                   | SST2    | Yes             | Yes           | 35.21         |              |\n| Math<br>&<br>Code | Yes     | No              | 86.24         | <b>35.77</b>  |              |\n| Math<br>&<br>Code | CoLA    | No              | No            | 45.54         | 98.53        |\n| Math<br>&<br>Code |         | No              | Yes           | 0.67          |              |\n| Math<br>&<br>Code | CoLA    | Yes             | No            | 71.72         | <b>6.42</b>  |\n| Math<br>&<br>Code | CoLA    | Yes             | Yes           | 67.11         |              |\n| LM<br>&<br>Math   | SST2    | No              | No            | 92.78         | <b>29.05</b> |\n|                   |         | LM<br>&<br>Math | No            | Yes           | 65.83        |\n|                   | SST2    | Yes             | No            | 91.28         | 34.55        |\n|                   | SST2    | Yes             | Yes           | 59.75         |              |\n| LM<br>&<br>Math   | CoLA    | No              | No            | 79.19         | 8.84         |\n| LM<br>&<br>Math   |         | No              | Yes           | 72.20         |              |\n| LM<br>&<br>Math   | CoLA    | Yes             | No            | 80.54         | <b>4.52</b>  |\n| LM<br>&<br>Math   | CoLA    | Yes             | Yes           | 76.89         |              |\n| LM<br>&<br>Code   | SST2    | No              | No            | 10.55         | 38.04        |\n|                   |         | LM<br>&<br>Code | No            | Yes           | 6.54         |\n|                   | SST2    | Yes             | No            | 73.17         | <b>7.68</b>  |\n|                   | SST2    | Yes             | Yes           | 67.55         |              |\n| LM<br>&<br>Code   | CoLA    | No              | No            | 74.21         | 47.42        |\n| LM<br>&<br>Code   |         | No              | Yes           | 39.02         |              |\n| LM<br>&<br>Code   | CoLA    | Yes             | No            | 74.78         | <b>31.67</b> |\n| LM<br>&<br>Code   | CoLA    | Yes             | Yes           | 51.10         |              |\n\nTable 2: Adversarial Robustness of Merged Models on the SST\n######################\nOutput:"

Out-of-Distribution Dataset Selection Details\n\nLiveBench [\\(White et al.,](#page-9-10) [2024\\)](#page-9-10) is a dynamic benchmark for large language models, featuring frequently updated questions and diverse tasks. To assess OOD robustness, we evaluate math & code, LM & math, and LM & code models using instruction following (LiveBench-Instruction), coding (LiveBench-Coding), and language comprehension (LiveBench-TypoFixing) category in LiveBench, respectively, deliberately avoiding the fine-tuning domains of the merged fine-tuned models. These tasks were released after November 2023, whereas WizardLM-13B, WizardMath-13B, and llama-2- 13b-code-alpaca were all introduced earlier. Furthermore, their shared Llama-2-13b backbone was trained on data only up to July 2023. Consequently, these factors collectively ensure that the evaluation remains OOD in the temporal dimension.\n\nWhen assessing the OOD robustness of LM & Code using the Language Comprehension category in LiveBench, only the typo-fixing task is considered. This decision is based on the fact that LiveBench is highly challenging, and the merged model performs poorly on other tasks in this category, with accuracy close to zero, rendering the evaluation results inconclusive and uninformative.\n\nFinally, we acknowledge the limitations of these datasets. For large models like Llama-2-13b, identifying truly OOD datasets is difficult, as their training data likely covers similar distributions. These datasets are better described as \"out-of-example\", representing instances not explicitly seen during training. As discussed in [\\(Wang et al.,](#page-9-8) [2023\\)](#page-9-8), distribution shifts can occur across domains and time. While Llama-2-13b may have been trained on datasets for tasks like instruction-following, coding, and language comprehension, the datasets we selected remain valuable for OOD evaluation by capturing temporal shifts, providing insights into robustness over time.\n\n### <span id=\"page-12-0\"></span>A.4 Adversarial Robustness Evaluation Experiments Setting Details\n\nPromptBench [\\(Zhu et al.,](#page-10-8) [2024\\)](#page-10-8) is a unified library designed for evaluating LLMs, providing a standardized and extensible framework. It includes several key components such as prompt construction, prompt engineering, dataset and model loading, adversarial prompt attacks, dynamic evaluation protocols, and analysis tools.\n\nWe use the Adversarial Prompt Attacks module in PromptBench aims to evaluate the robustness of LLMs against adversarial prompts. We employ three methods to perform adversarial attacks on prompts to evaluate the adversarial robustness of the merged models: DeepWordBug [\\(Gao et al.,](#page-8-16) [2018\\)](#page-8-16), BERTAttack [\\(Li et al.,](#page-9-16) [2020\\)](#page-9-16), and StressTest [\\(Naik et al.,](#page-9-17) [2018\\)](#page-9-17), representing Character-level, Word-level, and Sentence-level attacks, respectively.\n\n- DeepWordBug introduces subtle characterlevel perturbations (e.g., adding, deleting, or replacing characters) to words in text to deceive language models. It aims to evaluate a model's robustness against small typographical errors that may alter the model's performance without being easily detected.\n- BERTAttack manipulates text at the word level by replacing words with contextually similar synonyms to mislead large language models. This method tests the model's ability to maintain accuracy despite small lexical changes that might alter the meaning of the input.\n- StressTest appends irrelevant or redundant sentences to the end of a prompt to distract\n\n<span id=\"page-12-2\"></span>![](_page_12_Figure_7.jpeg)\n\nMerged Task Vector For task vectors within the dashed box, apply randomized linear interpolation to determine the final parameter value.\n\nTask Vector of Merged LLM\n\nTask Vector of LLM 1 Parameter\n\nInfluential values\n\nTask Vector of LLM 2\n\nThe values that align with the elected sign\n\nTask Vector of LLM 1 Parameter Task Vector of LLM 2 Task Vector of Merged LLM Influential values (b) After introducing M<sup>3</sup>, the Disjoint Merge step in the TIES-\n\nThe values that align with the elected sign\n\nMerging procedure.\n\n2.Elect the sign for 3.Disjoint Merge Merged\nnal TIES-Merging is that, in the Disjoint Merge step, Take their mean Figure 5: The difference between M<sup>3</sup> and the origiwhen two task vectors are retained for a given parameter, the mean of the task vectors is replaced by a random linear interpolation, while the other operations remain unchanged.\n\n> and confuse language models.

Using the Evol-Instruct method [\\(Xu et al.,](#page-10-7)\n\n[2024\\)](#page-10-7), it generates high-complexity instruction data to reduce human annotation and enhance generalization. The model undergoes supervised fine-tuning with AI-generated data, followed by refinement via RLHF. Evaluation results show that Evol-Instruct-generated instructions outperform human-written ones, and WizardLM-13B surpasses ChatGPT in high-complexity tasks. In GPT-4 automated evaluation, it achieves over 90% of ChatGPT's performance in 17 out of 29 tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of AI-evolved instruction fine-tuning [\\(Xu et al.,](#page-10-7) [2024\\)](#page-10-7).\n\n- WizardMath-13B, optimized from Llama-2- 13b, is designed for mathematical reasoning and enhances Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [\\(Wei](#page-9-21) [et al.,](#page-9-21) [2022\\)](#page-9-21) capabilities. It uses Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback to evolve math tasks and improve reasoning. Trained on GSM8K and MATH datasets, it excels in both basic and advanced math problems. In evaluations, WizardMath-Mistral 7B outperforms all open-source models with fewer training data, while WizardMath 70B surpasses GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude 2, and even early GPT-4 versions in mathematical reasoning tasks.\n- llama-2-13b-code-alpaca is a code generation model fine-tuned from Llama-2-13b, designed to enhance code understanding\n######################\nOutput:"

Bertattack prompt attack method.\n\nprompt attack method.\n\n## SST2 and CoLA datasets applying the BERTAttack\nC Integrating M<sup>3</sup> into the TIES-Merging Model Merging Method\n\nFigure [5](#page-12-2) shows the specific implementation approach to incorporating M<sup>3</sup> into TIES-Merging. After the steps of trimming parameters with lower magnitudes and resolving sign disagreements, the\n\ntwo models to be merged are denoted as M<sup>1</sup> and M2. During the M<sup>3</sup> process, only the parameters that are preserved in both M<sup>1</sup> and M2 are interpolated according to the model merging hyperparameter  $\\lambda\\_m$  to obtain the merged parameters. For parameters that are preserved in only one of the models, no interpolation is performed, and the original value from the preserved model is retained in the merged model.\n\n## <span id=\"page-14-0\"></span>D Performance Drop Rate (PDR) for Adversarial Robustness\n\nThe adversarial robustness is evaluated using the Performance Drop Rate (PDR) [\\(Zhu et al.,](#page-10-6) [2023\\)](#page-10-6), which is defined as follows:\n\n$$\\text{PDR} = \\frac{\\text{Metric}\\_{\\text{no attack}} - \\text{Metric}\\_{\\text{attack}}}{\\text{Metric}\\_{\\text{no attack}}},\\quad(9)$$\n\nwhere Metricno attack denotes the performance metric without any prompt attack, and Metricattack represents the performance metric under the prompt attack. A smaller PDR indicates stronger adversarial defense against prompt attacks, implying better adversarial robustness.\n\n### <span id=\"page-14-1\"></span>E Detailed Introduction to DARE\n\nDARE (Drop And REscale) [\\(Yu et al.,](#page-10-3) [2024\\)](#page-10-3) is a model sparsification method designed to reduce the redundancy of delta parameters in fine-tuned models while preserving their task-specific capabilities. In SFT, model parameters are optimized to unlock abilities for specific tasks, with the difference between fine-tuned and pre-trained parameters referred to as delta parameters.\n\nHowever, studies have shown that delta parameters are often highly redundant. DARE addresses this redundancy by randomly dropping a proportion  $p$  of delta parameters (referred to as the drop rate) and rescaling the remaining ones by a factor of  $1/(1 - p)$ . This simple yet effective approach enables DARE to eliminate up to 99% of delta parameters with minimal impact on model performance, particularly in large-scale models, and it can be applied using only CPUs.\n\nBeyond sparsification, DARE serves as a versatile plug-in for merging multiple homologous fine-tuned models (fine-tuned from the same base model) by reducing parameter interference. When combined with existing model merging techniques such as Average Merging, Task Arithmetic, and\n\nTIES-Merging, DARE facilitates the fusion of models while retaining or even enhancing task performance across multiple benchmarks. This effect is especially pronounced in decoder-based LMs, where DARE boosts task\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\n= \\\\theta\\\\_k - \\\\theta\\\\_{base}$ . The weights of the new, merged model  $\\\\theta\\\\_{new}$  are then computed by adding a weighted sum of these task vectors to the base model weights:  $\\\\theta\\\\_{new} = \\\\theta\\\\_{base} + \\\\sum\\\\_k \\\\lambda\\\\_k\\\\tau\\\\_k$  Here,  $\\\\lambda\\\\_k$  is a scaling parameter that determines the contribution of each task vector to the final merged model.\\n\\nA key problem of weight interpolation-based methods is that they neglect parameter interference, leading to performance degradation. A recent work [\\\\[63\\\\]](#page-20-3) identifies two key sources of interference: redundant parameter values and conflicting parameter signs across models, and proposes a method that addresses these issues to achieve improved merging performance. The proposed TIES-Merging method addresses information loss in existing merging methods by incorporating three steps: resetting minimal parameter changes, resolving sign conflicts, and merging only aligned parameters. The trimming of redundant parameter changes in TIES-Merging not only resulted in higher performance of merged models, but also achieved better compression for the fine-tuned parameter updates. This compression of fine-tuned weight parameter updates is further investigated in ComPEFT [\\\\[62\\\\]](#page-20-4).\\n\\nThe three steps of TIES-Merging are implemented as follows. In the first step, minimal parameter changes are reset by retaining only the most influential components of each task vector τ<sup>k</sup> and setting the rest to zero. This effectively removes redundant or insignificant modifications. The second step resolves sign conflicts across models by determining an aggregate sign for each parameter based on the overall direction of significant changes across all tasks. This ensures that conflicting updates do not cancel each other out. In the final step, only the aligned parameters are merged by selectively averaging the values of parameters that agree with the elected sign from the previous step, while excluding those that disagree. This selective merging process ensures that the final model incorporates only consistent and significant parameter changes from each task-specific model, thereby preserving task-relevant information while minimizing interference.\\n\\nAnother recent work [\\\\[65\\\\]](#page-20-5) proposes the DARE method, which goes further by zeroing out small differences between the fine-tuned model and the original base model, while amplifying the differences. In practice, DARE [\\\\[65\\\\]](#page-20-5) is often used together with Task Arithmetic [\\\\[27\\\\]](#page-19-10) or TIES-Merging [\\\\[63\\\\]](#page-20-3). Specifically, DARE operates as follows. It applies a random mask m<sup>k</sup> ∼ Bernoulli(p) to task vector τk, where p is the drop rate, and then rescales the remaining parameters:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{\\\\tau}\\\\_k = \\\\frac{1}{1-p} \\\\left( (1-m\\\\_k) \\\\odot \\\\tau\\\\_k \\\\right). \\\\tag{1}\\n$$\\n\\nThe resulting sparsified task vector τˆ<sup>k</sup> is then used to merge models. This task vector can be utilized in the aforementioned linear task arithmetic (referred to as DARE-Linear) or TIES (referred to as DARE-TIES) methods.\\n\\nModel merging is gaining momentum in ML research, and has been applied in areas such as multimodal model development [\\\\[7,](#page-18-5) [58\\\\]](#page-20-6) and merging experts [\\\\[7\\\\]](#page-18-5). It is also becoming popular in both the broader image generation and LLM communities, where due to the low barrier to entry, many researchers and engineers are continually merging existing models to create new customized models.\\n\\nIn the image generation domain, model merging techniques became widely accessible to practitioners especially after their implementation in open-source toolkits [\\\\[10\\\\]](#page-18-4). Similarly, language model merging really gained popularity after the implementation of *mergekit* [\\\\[21,](#page-18-0) [34\\\\]](#page-19-0). This toolkit provides all of the popular *recipes* for merging language models. In addition to simple linear and spherical interpolation, advanced recipes such as Task Arithmetic, TIES-Merging, DARE are also implemented, offering users the ability to experiment with combining these methods to work with fine-tunes of popular base models such as Mistral [\\\\[28\\\\]](#page-19-11). With this toolkit, a large number of capable merged models are developed by the community, and most of the top models on the Open LLM Leaderboard [\\\\[26\\\\]](#page-19-1) are gradually dominated by merged models produced by the community of language model enthusiasts.\\n\\nMergekit also introduced an additional method, called *Frankenmerging* which is not based on weight merging, but for the user to experiment with trying to stack different layers from multiple models to sequentially create a new model. This method has the advantage of not tying the user to one particular family of models with a fixed architecture for merging (e.g. Mistral-based models), but potentially creating *new* architectures from merging entirely different models. It is noted that discovering new *Frankenmerging* technique remains a challenge for the community, and requires much more trial and error to discover new recipes for this technique. To date, almost everyone uses a similar *Frankenmerging* merge recipe, and there has been very little trial and error to improve upon it. The field remains highly under-explored, and we believe this is where evolution can help.\\n\\n#### 1.1.3 Connection to Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search\\n\\nModel merging holds significant potential and democratizes the model-building\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging is a method designed to improve model merging performance by addressing parameter interference and information loss during the merging process.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DARE\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"DARE is a method that enhances model merging by zeroing out small differences between models while amplifying significant differences, facilitating effective model integration.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"mergekit\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Mergekit is a toolkit that provides various recipes for merging language models, making model merging techniques accessible to practitioners.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Mistral\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Mistral is a family of models that serves as a popular base for merging techniques in the language model community.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Open LLM Leaderboard\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The Open LLM Leaderboard is a ranking system that showcases the top language models, many of which are developed through community-driven merging efforts.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Frankenmerging\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Frankenmerging is a method that allows users to experiment with stacking layers from different models to create new architectures, distinct from traditional weight merging.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging\\\"<|>\\\"DARE\\\"<|>\\\"Both TIES-Merging and DARE are methods focused on improving the performance and effectiveness of model merging in machine learning.\\\".\\\"<|>\\\"model merging techniques, performance enhancement\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"mergekit\\\"<|>\\\"Mistral\\\"<|>\\\"Mergekit provides tools and recipes for merging models, including those based on the Mistral architecture, facilitating the creation of new models.\\\".\\\"<|>\\\"toolkit, model architecture\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Open LLM Leaderboard\\\"<|>\\\"mergekit\\\"<|>\\\"The Open LLM Leaderboard features top models that are frequently developed using techniques and tools provided by Mergekit.\\\".\\\"<|>\\\"model ranking, community development\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Frankenmerging\\\"<|>\\\"mergekit\\\"<|>\\\"Frankenmerging is one of the experimental methods supported by Mergekit, enabling users to create new model architectures.\\\".\\\"<|>\\\"experimental techniques, model creation\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"model merging, machine learning, parameter interference, language models, community-driven development\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\n1.1.1 Overview of Model Merging.\\n\\nModel merging offers a novel approach to leverage the strengths of multiple pre-trained models. It allows us to combine task-specific models, each potentially fine-tuned for a particular downstream task, into a single unified model. This technique stands in contrast to traditional transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is further fine-tuned for a new task. While transfer learning offers advantages like improved performance and faster convergence, the resulting models are typically limited to single tasks. Model merging, on the other hand, strives to create a versatile and comprehensive model by combining the knowledge from multiple pre-trained models, potentially yielding a model capable of handling various tasks simultaneously.\\n\\nWhile fine-tuning an existing model involves training an existing model further on a specialized dataset, model merging methods work by combining existing models without any additional gradientbased training, making it very cost-effective in terms of compute requirements. Many in the machine learning community, including researchers, hackers, and hobbyists alike, are using both fine-tuning and model-merging to create the best models for their purposes. In fact, this collaborative way of developing continually improved models has parallels with the traditional open-source software development approach [\\\\[47\\\\]](#page-19-2) where the trend is for the community to develop foundational machine learning models like open source software [\\\\[45,](#page-19-3) [46\\\\]](#page-19-4).\\n\\nA simple method of merging multiple models is to average the weights of multiple models finetuned from the same base initial model. This *model soup* approach [\\\\[61\\\\]](#page-20-0) demonstrated significant improvements on relatively large image processing and image classification models. The work pointed to similarity between weighted model averaging leading to a flat local minima. Theoretical [\\\\[17,](#page-18-1) [31,](#page-19-5) [32,](#page-19-6) [44\\\\]](#page-19-7) and empirical studies dating back from the 1990s [\\\\[24,](#page-18-2) [25\\\\]](#page-19-8) demonstrated that flatter local optima generalize better to out-of-distribution shifts. More recent work [\\\\[14,](#page-18-3) [41\\\\]](#page-19-9) examined the theoretical properties and practical implications of weight averaging applied to larger generative models.\\n\\nLinear weight averaging is performed as follows. Let  $\\\\theta\\\\_1, \\\\theta\\\\_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d$  represent the weight vectors of two distinct models, where d is the dimension of the weight space. The merged model's weights, denoted as  $\\\\theta\\\\_{new}$ , are computed using the following equation:  $\\\\theta\\\\_{new} = \\\\lambda \\\\theta\\\\_1 + (1 - \\\\lambda)\\\\theta\\\\_2$ . Here,  $\\\\lambda \\\\in [0, 1]$  is a weighting parameter that determines the relative contribution of each model to the final merged model. By adjusting  $\\\\lambda$ , practitioners can control the balance between the two original models' characteristics in the resulting merged model.\\n\\nLinear weight averaging not only works well for image processing and classification models, but is also effective for image generation models such as latent diffusion models. The release of Stable Diffusion [\\\\[50\\\\]](#page-20-1) led to a variety of specialist fine-tunes of the model for a variety of different styles, from photorealism, to anime, to realistic painting styles. Popular open-source WebUIs [\\\\[10\\\\]](#page-18-4) enabled practitioners to experiment with merging different models using linear or spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) [\\\\[60\\\\]](#page-20-2) of weight parameters of distinct fine-tuned Stable Diffusion models. This has led to the discovery of merged models that combine strengths of specialized models into a single model. For some time, the most popular Stable Diffusion models were neither the original base models nor the fine-tuned versions, but rather the merged models created by enthusiasts.\\n\\n#### 1.1.2 Merging Language Models\\n\\nSimple weight interpolation works well for merging image generation models that operate in a real valued latent and output space, but to our surprise, they also still work for merging language models under the right conditions, but have performance issues [\\\\[63\\\\]](#page-20-3). Recently, new methods have been proposed to address merging language models specifically. One method, Task Arithmetic [\\\\[27\\\\]](#page-19-10), involves building *task vectors* by subtracting pre-trained from fine-tuned model weights, enabling manipulation through arithmetic operations to steer the merged model's behavior.\\n\\nTask Arithmetic operates as follows. Let  $\\\\theta\\\\_{base} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d$  denote the weights of a pre-trained base model. For each task k, let  $\\\\theta\\\\_k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d$  represent the weights of a model fine-tuned for that specific task. The task vector  $\\\\tau\\\\_k$  for each task k is defined as the difference between the fine-tuned model weights and the base model weights:  $\\\\tau\\\\_k = \\\\theta\\\\_k - \\\\theta\\\\_{base}$ . The weights of the new, merged model  $\\\\theta\\\\_{new}$  are then computed by adding a weighted sum of these task vectors to the base model weights:  $\\\\theta\\\\_{new} = \\\\theta\\\\_{base} + \\\\sum\\\\_k \\\\lambda\\\\_k\\\\tau\\\\_k$  Here,  $\\\\lambda\\\\_k$  is a scaling parameter that determines the contribution of each\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Model Merging\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Model Merging is a technique in machine learning that combines multiple pre-trained models into a single unified model to leverage their strengths across various tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Pre-Trained Models\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Pre-Trained Models are machine learning models that have been previously trained on a large dataset and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Transfer Learning\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Transfer Learning is a machine learning approach where a pre-trained model is further fine-tuned for a new, related task.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Fine-Tuning\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Fine-Tuning is the process of training an existing model further on a specialized dataset to improve its performance for a specific task.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Machine Learning Community\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The Machine Learning Community encompasses researchers, developers, and enthusiasts who collaborate on developing and improving machine learning models and techniques.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Open Source Software Development\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Open Source Software Development refers to the collaborative approach of creating software where the source code is made freely available for modification and enhancement.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Stable Diffusion\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Stable Diffusion is a generative model that has been widely adopted for creating images and has spawned various specialized fine-tuned versions for different styles.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Task Arithmetic\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Task Arithmetic is a method for merging language models by creating task vectors that manipulate model weights to adjust the merged model's behavior.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Model Merging\\\"<|>\\\"Transfer Learning\\\"<|>\\\"Model Merging offers a different approach compared to Transfer Learning, focusing on combining multiple models rather than fine-tuning a single model.\\\"<|>\\\"model techniques, machine learning\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Machine Learning Community\\\"<|>\\\"Model Merging\\\"<|>\\\"The Machine Learning Community actively engages in developing and applying techniques like Model Merging to enhance model performance.\\\"<|>\\\"collaboration, community engagement\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Open Source Software Development\\\"<|>\\\"Machine Learning Community\\\"<|>\\\"The principles of Open Source Software Development are reflected in the collaborative nature of the Machine Learning Community.\\\"<|>\\\"collaborative principles, software development\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Stable Diffusion\\\"<|>\\\"Model Merging\\\"<|>\\\"Stable Diffusion has inspired enthusiasts to create merged models by combining strengths from various fine-tuned versions.\\\"<|>\\\"model merging, generative models\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Task Arithmetic\\\"<|>\\\"Model Merging\\\"<|>\\\"Task Arithmetic is a specific method that enhances the process of merging models, particularly for language models.\\\"<|>\\\"model enhancement, merging techniques\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"model merging, machine learning, pre-trained models, transfer learning, community collaboration\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

{takiba,mkshing,yujintang,qisun,hadavid}@sakana.ai\\n\\n## Abstract\\n\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable, but their development often requires substantial computational resources. While model merging has emerged as a cost-effective promising approach for creating new models by combining existing ones, it currently relies on human intuition and domain knowledge, limiting its potential. Here, we propose an evolutionary approach that overcomes this limitation by automatically discovering effective combinations of diverse open-source models, harnessing their collective intelligence without requiring extensive additional training data or compute. Our approach operates in both parameter space and data flow space, allowing for optimization beyond just the weights of the individual models. This approach even facilitates crossdomain merging, generating models like a Japanese LLM with Math reasoning capabilities. Surprisingly, our Japanese Math LLM achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of established Japanese LLM benchmarks, even surpassing models with significantly more parameters, despite not being explicitly trained for such tasks. Furthermore, a culturally-aware Japanese VLM generated through our approach demonstrates its effectiveness in describing Japanese culture-specific content, outperforming previous Japanese VLMs. This work not only contributes new state-of-the-art models back to the open-source community, but also introduces a new paradigm for automated model composition, paving the way for exploring alternative, efficient approaches to foundation model development.\\n\\n## 1 Introduction\\n\\nModel merging [\\\\[21,](#page-18-0) [34\\\\]](#page-19-0), a recent development in the large language model (LLM) community, presents a novel paradigm shift. By strategically combining multiple LLMs into a single architecture, this exciting development has captured the attention of researchers due to its key advantage: it requires no additional training, making it an incredibly cost-effective approach for developing new models. This accessibility has fueled a surge in interest and experimentation with model merging. The Open LLM Leaderboard [\\\\[26\\\\]](#page-19-1) is now dominated by merged models, showcasing its potential for democratizing foundation model development.\\n\\nHowever, model merging is considered by many to be a form of black art or alchemy, relying on the model maker's intuition and instincts about model selection and merging recipes to create and refine a new model that performs well for a particular task. Furthermore, the model maker is often required to have some domain knowledge for the various different benchmark tasks. Given the large diversity of open models and benchmarks in the community, human intuition can only go so far, and we believe a more systematic approach for discovering new model combinations will take things much further.\\n\\nWe believe evolutionary algorithms will be able to discover more effective model merging solutions, and thus provide a path for automating the creation of more capable models. As a step towards this direction, in this work, we show that evolution can be employed to discover novel and unintuitive ways to merge multiple models to produce new models with a new combined ability. In this work, we present a methodology that leverages evolutionary algorithms to facilitate the merging of foundation models. Our approach is distinguished by its ability to navigate both parameter space (weights) and the data flow space (inference path), proposing a framework that integrates these two dimensions.\\n\\nThis work makes several key contributions to the field of foundation model development:\\n\\n- 1. Automated Model Composition: We introduce Evolutionary Model Merge, a general evolutionary method to automatically discover effective combinations of selected models for creating new foundation models with user-specified capabilities. This approach harnesses the collective intelligence of existing open models, enabling the creation of powerful models without the need for extensive training data or compute.\\n- 2. Cross-Domain Merging: We demonstrate that our method can discover novel ways to merge models from disparate domains (e.g., non-English language and Math, non-English language and Vision), potentially exceeding the capabilities achievable through conventional human design strategies.\\n- 3. State-of-the-Art Performance: We showcase the effectiveness of our method by automatically generating a Japanese LLM with Math reasoning capability and a Japanese Vision-Language Model (VLM). Notably, both models achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, even without explicit optimization for those tasks.\\n- 4. High Efficiency and Surprising Generalizability: We observe that our 7B parameter LLM surpasses the performance of some previous 70B parameter Japanese LLMs on benchmark datasets, highlighting the high efficiency and surprising generalization capability of our approach. We believe this model can serve as a strong general-purpose Japanese LLM.\\n- 5. Culturally-Aware VLM: The generated Japanese VLM achieves top results when tested on a domestically-sourced dataset of Japanese image-description pairs, demonstrating its ability to handle Japanese culture-specific content.\\n\\nWe are committed to open science and are excited to open-source our EvoLLM-JP and EvoVLM-JP, two state-of-the-art Japanese foundation models, to the community, enabling further research and development in the field. Our work challenges the conventional paradigm of expensive model development by demonstrating that our evolutionary-based method can produce competitive models without relying on gradient-based training. This paves the way for exploring alternative, potentially more efficient, approaches to foundation model development.\\n\\n### 1.1 Background and Related Work\\n\\n### 1.1.1 Overview of Model Merging.\\n\\nModel merging offers a novel approach to leverage the strengths of multiple pre-trained models. It allows us to combine task-specific models, each potentially fine-tuned for a particular downstream task, into a single unified model. This technique stands in contrast to traditional transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is further fine-tuned for a new task. While transfer learning offers advantages like improved performance and faster convergence, the resulting models are typically limited to single tasks\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Takuya Akiba\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Takuya Akiba is a researcher involved in the development of evolutionary optimization methods for model merging in machine learning.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Makoto Shing\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Makoto Shing is a researcher contributing to the study of evolutionary optimization techniques in the context of model merging.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Yujin Tang\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Yujin Tang is a researcher focused on evolutionary approaches to combining models for enhanced performance in machine learning.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Qi Sun\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Qi Sun is a researcher participating in the exploration of effective model merging strategies using evolutionary algorithms.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"David Ha\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"David Ha is a researcher contributing to the field of AI and model merging, particularly through evolutionary methods.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Sakana AI\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Sakana AI is an organization based in Tokyo, Japan, focused on advancing AI technologies and methodologies.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Tokyo\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Tokyo is the capital city of Japan and the location where Sakana AI is based.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Evolutionary Model Merge\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Evolutionary Model Merge refers to a method developed to automatically discover effective combinations of existing models for creating new foundation models.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese LLM\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The Japanese LLM is a large language model specifically designed to understand and generate Japanese text, showcasing advanced capabilities in various tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese VLM\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The Japanese VLM is a vision-language model that integrates visual and textual information, tailored for understanding Japanese culture-specific content.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Model Merging\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Model Merging is a technique in AI that combines multiple pre-trained models into a single model to leverage their strengths for better performance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Takuya Akiba\\\"<|>\\\"Sakana AI\\\"<|>\\\"Takuya Akiba is affiliated with Sakana AI, contributing to the organization's research in evolutionary model merging.\\\"<|>\\\"research affiliation, collaboration\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Makoto Shing\\\"<|>\\\"Sakana AI\\\"<|>\\\"Makoto Shing works at Sakana AI, focusing on evolutionary optimization methods in AI development.\\\"<|>\\\"research affiliation, collaboration\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Yujin Tang\\\"<|>\\\"Sakana AI\\\"<|>\\\"Yujin Tang is part of Sakana AI, engaged in research on model merging techniques using evolutionary algorithms.\\\"<|>\\\"research affiliation, collaboration\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Qi Sun\\\"<|>\\\"Sakana AI\\\"<|>\\\"Qi Sun is affiliated with Sakana AI, contributing to the exploration of effective model merging strategies.\\\"<|>\\\"research affiliation, collaboration\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"David Ha\\\"<|>\\\"Sakana AI\\\"<|>\\\"David Ha is a researcher at Sakana AI, involved in the development of advanced AI models through evolutionary methods.\\\"<|>\\\"research affiliation, collaboration\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Evolutionary Model Merge\\\"<|>\\\"Model Merging\\\"<|>\\\"Evolutionary Model Merge is a specific approach to model merging that automates the discovery of effective combinations of models.\\\"<|>\\\"methodology, optimization\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese LLM\\\"<|>\\\"Evolutionary Model Merge\\\"<|>\\\"The Japanese LLM was developed using the Evolutionary Model Merge approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating advanced models.\\\"<|>\\\"model development, application\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese VLM\\\"<|>\\\"Evolutionary Model Merge\\\"<|>\\\"The Japanese VLM was also generated through the Evolutionary Model Merge methodology, showcasing its capabilities in cultural contexts.\\\"<|>\\\"model development, application\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Tokyo\\\"<|>\\\"Sakana AI\\\"<|>\\\"Sakana AI is located in Tokyo, Japan, where it conducts its research and development activities.\\\"<|>\\\"organization location, operational base\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"model merging, evolutionary algorithms, AI development, Japanese language models, cultural awareness\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\n* technique remains a challenge for the community, and requires much more trial and error to discover new recipes for this technique. To date, almost everyone uses a similar *Frankenmerging* merge recipe, and there has been very little trial and error to improve upon it. The field remains highly under-explored, and we believe this is where evolution can help.\\n\\n#### 1.1.3 Connection to Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search\\n\\nModel merging holds significant potential and democratizes the model-building process, making it accessible to a broad range of participants. However, it heavily relies on intuition and domain knowledge. Human intuition, however, has its limits. With the growing diversity of open models and tasks, we need a more systematic approach. We believe evolutionary algorithms, inspired by natural selection, can unlock more effective merging solutions. These algorithms can explore a vast space of possibilities, discovering novel and counter-intuitive combinations that traditional methods and human intuition might miss.\\n\\nIn deep learning, techniques such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS) [\\\\[66\\\\]](#page-20-7) employed evolutionary techniques to discover new architectures [\\\\[48,](#page-19-12) [55\\\\]](#page-20-8) that might be non-intuitive for human designers to discover. However, NAS-methods consumed significant computational resources given how each candidate model architecture needed to be trained. Our approach aims to *save* compute resources by discovering structures that take advantage of existing capabilities of existing Transformer blocks that had already consumed considerable resources to train in the first place.\\n\\nPre-trained transformer blocks are akin to neural network components one can choose to mix and match using an evolutionary architecture search algorithm. However, unlike NAS, we do not need to train the model, and can evaluate the candidates right away. In a sense, our work resonates with the goals of earlier works of morphology search such as NEAT [\\\\[56\\\\]](#page-20-9) and more recent work such as Weight Agnostic Neural Networks [\\\\[18\\\\]](#page-18-6) which evolved neural network structures with certain task-specific inductive biases, without the need to train the weight parameters using gradient descent. Similarly, this was how NAS methods such as SMASH [\\\\[56\\\\]](#page-20-9) avoided costly inner-loop training through the application of a Hypernetwork [\\\\[22\\\\]](#page-18-7) to estimate the weights of architectural candidates.\\n\\nRecent work in language models tried to duplicate the layers of a pre-trained Transformer many times [\\\\[58\\\\]](#page-20-6) as a starting point to pre-train a much larger network, to enable efficient training of much larger language models [\\\\[64\\\\]](#page-20-10). Similarly, in our approach, we are interested in applying automated search methods to discover the effective reuse of existing pre-trained layers.\\n\\nIn this work, we apply evolution to not only automate the optimization of model merging recipes in weight space, confined to a single architecture, but also explore applying evolution to optimize the stacking of layers from different models—a more involved approach that has the potential to create\\n\\nentirely novel neural architectures from existing building blocks. Unlike weight merging optimization which confine space of models to be merged together to fine-tuned descendents of the same parent base model, layer stacking optimization has no such constraints. Our work systematically explores the application of evolution applied in both parameter and layer space.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-4-1\\\"></span>2 Methods\\n\\nOur goal is to create a unified framework capable of automatically generating a merged model from a any individual in the collection. Central to our approach is the application of evolutionary algorithms, which we employ to refine the intricacies involved in model merging. To systematically address this challenge, we first dissect the merging process into two distinct, orthogonal configuration spaces, analyzing their individual impacts. Building on this analysis, we then introduce a cohesive framework that seamlessly integrates these spaces. Figure [1](#page-4-0) provides a schematic representation of our approach. ✅ ❎ ✅\\n\\n✅\\n\\n✅\\n\\n✅\\n\\nQ2: Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. … How much will she have spent on ice cream after 60 days?\\n\\n![](_page_4_Figure_4.jpeg)\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-4-0\\\"></span>Figure 1: Overview of Evolutionary Model Merge. Our approach encompasses (1) evolving the weights for mixing parameters at each layer in the parameter space (PS); (2) evolving layer permutations in the data flow space (DFS); and (3) an integrated strategy that combines both methods for merging in both PS and DFS. Notice that merging in the PS is not simple copying and stitching of the layers parameters, but also mixes the weights. This merging is akin to blending colors as illustrated here (e.g., red and blue becomes purple). Note that we translated the questions to English for the reader; the models operate on Japanese text.\\n\\n### 2.1 Merging in the Parameter Space\\n\\nModel merging in the parameter space (PS) aims to integrate the weights of multiple foundational models into a unified entity with the same neural network architecture, yet outperforming the individual models. While various strategies for combining model parameters exist [\\\\[41,](#page-19-9) [61\\\\]](#page-20-0), our approach leverages task vectors analysis to understand each model's strengths, based on the specific tasks they are optimized for or excel in [\\\\[27\\\\]](#page-19-10). Specifically, we enhance TIES-Merging with DARE [\\\\[63,](#page-20-3) [65\\\\]](#page-20-5), allowing for more granular, layer-wise merging (In this paper, by \\\"layer\\\" we mean the input/output embedding layers or a transformer block).

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\neach model's strengths, based on the specific tasks they are optimized for or excel in [\\\\[27\\\\]](#page-19-10). Specifically, we enhance TIES-Merging with DARE [\\\\[63,](#page-20-3) [65\\\\]](#page-20-5), allowing for more granular, layer-wise merging (In this paper, by \\\"layer\\\" we mean the input/output embedding layers or a transformer block). We establish merging configuration parameters for sparsification and weight mixing at each layer, including input and output embeddings. These configurations are then optimized using an evolutionary algorithm, such as CMA-ES [\\\\[23\\\\]](#page-18-8), for selected tasks, guided by critical task-specific metrics (e.g., accuracy for MGSM, ROUGE score for VQA).\\n\\n## 2.2 Merging in the Data Flow Space\\n\\nRecent analysis and discoveries imply that knowledge is stored distributedly in language models [\\\\[20,](#page-18-9) [42,](#page-19-13) [43\\\\]](#page-19-14), suggesting simple yet novel model merging possibilities in the data flow space (DFS). Unlike\\n\\nmerging in PS, model merging in DFS preserves the original weights of each layer intact. Instead, it optimizes the inference path that tokens follow as they traverse through the neural network. For example, after the i-th layer in model A, a token may be directed to the j-th layer in model B.\\n\\nIn our initial effort in this domain, we limit ourselves to serial connections and non-adaptive configurations, deferring the investigation of more flexible model merging to future work. Concretely, with a collection of N models and a budget T, our method searches for a sequence of layer indices L (t) i,j that delineates the path all the tokens should follow for a specific task. Here Li,j denotes the j-th layer in the i-th model, with t ∈ [1, T] marking the step in the inference path.\\n\\nOne can quickly imagine how large the search space is. Assuming the total number of layers across all models is  $M$ , the size of the search space is  $(M + 1)^T$ , here the extra one indicates the inclusion of a pass-through layer. Even with a modest setting of  $M = 64$  (e.g., 2 models of 32 layers each) and  $T = 60$ , this setting translates to an astronomically large search space, a challenge even for a capable evolutionary search algorithm. Luckily, our preliminary studies indicated that certain layer arrangements, particularly repetitive or permuted sequences from earlier in the model, can adversely affect performance. Based on this, we modify our settings to include an indicator array  $\\\\mathcal{I}$  of size  $T = M \\\\times r$  in the evolutionary search space, here  $r$  is number of repetitions.\\n\\nConceptually, we layout all the layers in sequential order (i.e., all layers in the *i*-th model followed by those in the *i* + 1-th model) and repeat them  $r$  times, the indicator array then manages the inclusion/exclusion of layers. If  $\\\\mathcal{I}\\\\_i > 0$  we include the layer corresponding to index  $i$  in the slots in the merged model, otherwise we exclude it. Consequently, our search space is reduced to  $2^T$ , which is still large, but tractable for evolutionary search.\\n\\nIn our search, we only optimize the data inference path inside the merged model and keep parameters in the models intact. In this setting, a layer may face an input whose distribution is different from what it is used to (from its original model), leading to unexpected outputs. For example, our preliminary studies [\\\\[57\\\\]](#page-20-11) show that swapping a pair of neighboring layers in a language model makes its performance drop. Although more theoretical studies are needed to model the distribution shift, empirically we find that appropriately scaling an input that wishes to go from layer  $i$  to  $j$  by  $W\\\\_{ij}$  help alleviate the problem. Here,  $W \\\\in R^{M \\\\times M}$  is a matrix that is also optimized by the evolutionary search together with the indicator array  $\\\\mathcal{I}$ .\\n\\nThe size of  $W$  grows quadratically with  $M$ , for scenarios involving a large number of layers. An alternative approach to contain the search space size involves parameterizing  $W$  with a neural network [\\\\[22,](#page-18-7) [51\\\\]](#page-20-12). We can instead evolve a feed-forward network to output the scaling weights conditioned on the layer and step indices:  $W\\\\_{ij} = \\\\pi\\\\_{\\\\theta}(i, j, t)$  where  $\\\\theta$ 's are the parameters to be evolved, whose size does not change when  $M$  grows.\\n\\n#### 2.3 Merging in Both Spaces\\n\\nModel merging in the PS and in the DFS are orthogonal approaches, however, it is straightforward to combine these disentangled methods and further boost the performance of a merged model. As we show in the rightmost illustration in Figure [1](#page-4-0) and in Section [3.1,](#page-6-0) it is possible to first apply PS merging to a collection of models, and then put back this merged model in the collection and apply DFS merging from this enlarged collection.\\n\\nThis can be extremely helpful when one considers model merging with multiple objectives, wherein PS merging can be applied first to produce several merged models each of which targets one of\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging is a model merging technique that enhances performance by optimizing configurations for specific tasks in neural networks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DARE\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"DARE is a method that works in conjunction with TIES-Merging to provide more granular merging capabilities in neural network layers.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"CMA-ES\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"CMA-ES is an evolutionary algorithm used to optimize merging configuration parameters in neural networks based on critical task-specific metrics.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Data Flow Space (DFS)\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Data Flow Space refers to a conceptual space where model merging preserves original weights and optimizes the inference path for tokens in neural networks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Merging Configuration Parameters\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Merging Configuration Parameters are settings established for sparsification and weight mixing at each layer of a neural network.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Evolutionary Search\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Evolutionary Search is a method used to explore a large search space of layer arrangements in model merging.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging\\\"<|>\\\"DARE\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging enhances its functionality through the integration of DARE, allowing for more precise model merging techniques.\\\"<|>\\\"model enhancement, integration\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"CMA-ES\\\"<|>\\\"Merging Configuration Parameters\\\"<|>\\\"CMA-ES optimizes the merging configuration parameters to improve model performance based on task-specific metrics.\\\"<|>\\\"optimization, performance improvement\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Data Flow Space (DFS)\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging\\\"<|>\\\"Merging in the Data Flow Space (DFS) complements TIES-Merging by preserving original weights while optimizing inference paths.\\\"<|>\\\"model merging, optimization\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Evolutionary Search\\\"<|>\\\"Merging Configuration Parameters\\\"<|>\\\"Evolutionary Search is employed to navigate the search space of merging configuration parameters, enhancing the merging process.\\\"<|>\\\"search optimization, parameter tuning\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"model merging, neural networks, optimization, evolutionary algorithms, performance enhancement\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nwe show in the rightmost illustration in Figure [1](#page-4-0) and in Section [3.1,](#page-6-0) it is possible to first apply PS merging to a collection of models, and then put back this merged model in the collection and apply DFS merging from this enlarged collection.\\n\\nThis can be extremely helpful when one considers model merging with multiple objectives, wherein PS merging can be applied first to produce several merged models each of which targets one of the muliple objectives of interest, and then DFS merging is applied with multi-objective genetic algorithms such as NSGA-II [\\\\[16\\\\]](#page-18-10) to further expand the final model's performance in relevant metrics.\\n\\n## 3 Results\\n\\nMost merged models in the community optimize for a narrow set of tasks defined in The Open LLM Leaderboard [\\\\[26\\\\]](#page-19-1). Our motivation is for evolutionary search to discover novel ways to merge different models from vastly different domains (e.g., non-English language and Math, or non-English language and Vision) which might be difficult for human experts to discover effective merging solutions themselves. Furthermore, effectively merging models from very different domains can lead to models of wider real-world applicability and enable us to develop models beyond the large population of models that are optimized for the narrow range of tasks defined by a leaderboard.\\n\\nWe demonstrate our Evolutionary Model Merge approach described in Section [2](#page-4-1) by evolving a Japanese LLM capable of Math reasoning, and a Japanese VLM proficient in handling culturallyspecific content. Specifically, in Section [3.1,](#page-6-0) we apply evolution to merge a Japanese LLM with an English Math LLM to build a Japanese Math LLM, and in Section [3.3,](#page-13-0) we apply evolution to merge a Japanese LLM with an English VLM to create a Japanese VLM.\\n\\n#### <span id=\\\"page-6-0\\\"></span>3.1 Evolving Japanese Math LLM\\n\\n#### 3.1.1 Experimental Setup\\n\\nSource Models To develop a model capable of solving math problems in Japanese, we apply evolutionary model merge on a set of source models containing a Japanese LLM and Math LLMs: shisa-gamma-7b-v1 [\\\\[9\\\\]](#page-18-11) (Japanese LLM), WizardMath-7B-V1.1 [\\\\[40\\\\]](#page-19-15) and Abel-7B-002 [\\\\[12\\\\]](#page-18-12). All these models are fine-tuned from Mistral-7B-v0.1 [\\\\[28\\\\]](#page-19-11).\\n\\nDataset For testing, we used the MGSM dataset [\\\\[52\\\\]](#page-20-13), a multilingual translation of a subset of the GSM8k dataset [\\\\[13\\\\]](#page-18-13). The Japanese test set of MGSM, consisting of 250 samples, was used for the final evaluation. Specifically, MGSM contains translations of the first 250 samples (ID 0-249) from the GSM8k test set. We used a different dataset for evolutionary search to avoid overfitting the test set. Specifically, we translated the remaining 1069 samples (out of 1319 examples) of the GSM8k test set that were not included in the MGSM test set into Japanese. These correspond to samples with IDs 250-1318 in the original GSM8k test set, ensuring no overlap with the MGSM Japanese test set. One may think that it is more natural to translate the GSM8k training set. However, in our preliminary efforts, this approach did not work well. Since open-source math models were trained on the GSM8k training set, we were unable to perform accurate evaluations.\\n\\nEvaluation We evaluated the ability to generate Japanese answers to Japanese math problems. Therefore, we considered an answer correct if it met the following criteria: (1) the concluding numerical value must be correct, and (2) the reasoning text should be written in Japanese.\\n\\nWe treated the last numerical value appearing in the output as the answer. We needed to adopt this heuristic because we are merging multiple models that were trained in different formats, which made it difficult to correct the output format. This method appeared to extract the answers correctly in almost all cases. Additionally, to determine the language of the output, we utilized fasttext [\\\\[29,](#page-19-16) [30\\\\]](#page-19-17). We used greedy sampling for generation and calculated the zero-shot pass@1 accuracy.\\n\\nOptimization For optimization in PS, we used the CMA-ES[\\\\[23\\\\]](#page-18-8) algorithm implemented in Optuna [\\\\[8\\\\]](#page-18-14) with default hyper-parameters. Specifically, we set all initial parameter values to 0.5, sigma to 1/6, and the population size to  $4 + \\\\lfloor 3 \\\\ln(n\\\\_{\\\\text{params}}) \\\\rfloor$ , where  $n\\\\_{\\\\text{params}}$  is the number of parameters to optimize. The fitness value is defined as the accuracy for all 1069 training samples. Please note that this set is disjoint from MGSM's test set. The optimization was conducted for 1000 trials, and the best trial with respect to the training accuracy was chosen as the final model. We decided to employ TIES-Merging [\\\\[63\\\\]](#page-20-3) with DARE [\\\\[65\\\\]](#page-20-5) through preliminary experiments, and optimized its parameters.\\n\\nIn our DFS merging experiments,  $M = 64$ ,  $r = 3$\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"PS Merging\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"PS Merging is a technique used to combine multiple models in a way that optimizes for various objectives, enhancing the model's performance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DFS Merging\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"DFS Merging is a method applied after PS Merging to further refine the models, often utilizing multi-objective genetic algorithms like NSGA-II.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Evolutionary Model Merge\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Evolutionary Model Merge is an approach that evolves models through merging, aiming to create new models capable of handling complex tasks across different domains.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese LLM\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The Japanese LLM is a language model designed to process and generate text in Japanese, utilized in the model merging experiments.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Math LLMs\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Math LLMs are language models specifically trained to solve mathematical problems, contributing to the merging process for enhanced capabilities.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MGSM Dataset\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The MGSM Dataset is a multilingual translation dataset used for evaluating the performance of language models on math problems in Japanese.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"GSM8k Dataset\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The GSM8k Dataset is a benchmark dataset for evaluating mathematical reasoning in language models, providing a test set for model accuracy.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Mistral-7B\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Mistral-7B is a foundational model from which other models are fine-tuned, including the Japanese LLM and Math LLMs.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"CMA-ES Algorithm\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"CMA-ES is an optimization algorithm used in the PS Merging process to enhance model parameters for better performance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Optuna\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Optuna is a software framework used for hyperparameter optimization, particularly in the context of the CMA-ES algorithm.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"PS Merging\\\"<|>\\\"DFS Merging\\\"<|>\\\"PS Merging is applied first to optimize models before DFS Merging is used to refine them, indicating a sequential relationship in the merging process.\\\"<|>\\\"model optimization, sequential methods\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Evolutionary Model Merge\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese LLM\\\"<|>\\\"The Evolutionary Model Merge approach utilizes the Japanese LLM to solve math problems, demonstrating its application in merging models across different domains.\\\"<|>\\\"model application, domain merging\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese LLM\\\"<|>\\\"Math LLMs\\\"<|>\\\"The Japanese LLM is merged with Math LLMs to create a model capable of solving math problems in Japanese, indicating collaboration between different types of models.\\\"<|>\\\"collaboration, model merging\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"MGSM Dataset\\\"<|>\\\"GSM8k Dataset\\\"<|>\\\"The MGSM Dataset is derived from the GSM8k Dataset, indicating a direct relationship in their usage for evaluating language models on math problems.\\\"<|>\\\"dataset relationship, evaluation\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"CMA-ES Algorithm\\\"<|>\\\"Optuna\\\"<|>\\\"The CMA-ES Algorithm is implemented within Optuna for hyperparameter optimization, showing how the two are interconnected in the model optimization process.\\\"<|>\\\"optimization techniques, software integration\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"model merging, optimization techniques, language models, evaluation datasets, evolutionary algorithms\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

configurations, such as varying the assignment of merging parameters across different layer groups. However, due to a constrained dataset, we did not witness notable improvements in performance correlating with increase in configuration complexity. Consequently, we focused our reporting on a PS merged model (Model 4 in Table [1\\\\)](#page-7-0) that adopts the simplest setting: considering each source model as a singular layer and allocating two DARE-TIES associated parameters to each for evolutionary merging. Figure [3](#page-9-0) illustrates the evolved parameter configuration post PS merging.\\n\\nThe CMA-ES optimization results reveals that all three models are important, as suggested by the uniformity of the optimized weighting values. The fact that the sum of the weights exceeds 1 and is approaching 2, is noteworthy. This suggests that a combination method which amplifies the contributions of the models, rather than a simple interpolation, proved to be more effective.\\n\\nThe dominant density from the Japanese LLM suggests its critical contribution to solving the task. We conjecture that this may also be partially attributed to the Japanese LM's larger amount of fine-tunings from the Mistral base model. Japanese LMs based on English models, such as Shisa-Gamma-7B-v1, are typically created through a two-step process: continued pretraining and instruction fine-tuning. The continued pretraining phase involves learning from a significantly larger dataset compared to standard fine-tuning. For instance, Shisa-Gamma-7B-v1 is based on a Japanese base model that underwent continued pretraining on 100B tokens of Japanese text. The resulting differences in weights between Shisa-Gamma-7B-v1 and the original Mistral-7B-v1 likely encapsulate more information than standard fine-tuning, making them more challenging to sparsify. In line with the discussion in [\\\\[65,](#page-20-5) Section 4.6], the sparsification of DARE tends to degrade performance when applied to such extensively fine-tuned models. Our evolutionary search has seemingly managed to address this issue by increasing the density for the Japanese LM.\\n\\nThe parameter settings derived from our PS merging experiments align well with outcomes from our DFS merging efforts. By incorporating the PS-merged model into our pool of source models and applying DFS merging across all potential pairings, we observed optimal performance with the combination of the PS-merged model and the Japanese language mode (Model 6 in Table [1\\\\)](#page-7-0). This finding echoes the significant influence of the Japanese language model, as indicated by its notable presence in Figure [3,](#page-9-0) and reaffirms the substantial promise of evolutionary model merging.\\n\\n![](_page_9_Figure_1.jpeg)\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-9-0\\\"></span>Figure 3: Evolved Configurations for PS merging. Although the weights are similar across the 3 source models, the pronounced density from the Japanese LLM underscores its pivotal role.\\n\\nFigure [4](#page-9-1) displays the evolution of the inference path, where our approach consistently recognized the value of initial steps, incorporating every layer from the first model (our PS-merged model), except for the last decoding layer and the embedding layer. As the process advanced, the method refined the selection to a smaller, more effective set of layers and strategically alternated between layers from both contributing models. Significantly, the scaling parameters  $W\\\\_{ij}$  emerged as crucial elements, our ablation studies revealed that eliminating them in the evolved model (e.g., by setting  $W\\\\_{ij} = 1$ ) led to a performance decline exceeding 20 percent, highlighting their importance in the model's efficacy.\\n\\n![](_page_9_Figure_4.jpeg)\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-9-1\\\"></span>Figure 4\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Ours (DFS)\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Ours (DFS) is an organization involved in model merging and optimization, showcasing various performance metrics.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Ours (PS+DFS)\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Ours (PS+DFS) is an organization that focuses on merging models with specific parameters for enhanced performance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Llama 2 70B\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Llama 2 70B refers to a specific model that is part of the analysis, showcasing performance metrics in the context of model evaluation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese Stable LM 70B\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese Stable LM 70B is a language model that plays a critical role in the analysis, particularly noted for its contributions.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Swallow 70B\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Swallow 70B is another model referenced in the performance analysis, contributing metrics to the overall evaluation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"CMA-ES Optimization Results\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"CMA-ES optimization results refer to the findings from the optimization process that highlight the importance of model contributions in merging.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Parameter Configuration Post PS Merging\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Parameter configuration post PS merging refers to the evolved settings derived from the merging experiments.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Ours (DFS)\\\"<|>\\\"CMA-ES Optimization Results\\\"<|>\\\"The CMA-ES optimization results are derived from the merging efforts of Ours (DFS), showcasing the effectiveness of the model.\\\")<|>\\\"model optimization, performance evaluation\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Ours (PS+DFS)\\\"<|>\\\"CMA-ES Optimization Results\\\"<|>\\\"The results of CMA-ES optimization are influenced by the configurations used in Ours (PS+DFS), indicating a connection between the two.\\\")<|>\\\"model optimization, performance relationship\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Llama 2 70B\\\"<|>\\\"Parameter Configuration Post PS Merging\\\"<|>\\\"The performance metrics of Llama 2 70B are part of the parameter configuration derived from PS merging efforts.\\\")<|>\\\"model performance, parameter analysis\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese Stable LM 70B\\\"<|>\\\"CMA-ES Optimization Results\\\"<|>\\\"The Japanese Stable LM 70B is noted for its significant contribution to the CMA-ES optimization results, indicating its importance in the analysis.\\\")<|>\\\"model contribution, optimization results\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Swallow 70B\\\"<|>\\\"Parameter Configuration Post PS Merging\\\"<|>\\\"Swallow 70B's performance metrics are included in the parameter configuration analysis post PS merging.\\\")<|>\\\"model performance, parameter analysis\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"model merging, optimization, performance analysis, parameter configuration, Japanese language models\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

While the leap in performance is not as pronounced as with PS merging, it still proves to be a valid and orthogonal approach. Finally, our hybrid model (Model 6), which integrates both merging strategies, shows further enhancements on the task. The order of the source models in the indicator array  $I$  affects the performance of the DFS merging method. We conduct experiments with all possible combinations and report the best scores in Table [1,](#page-7-0) we defer detailed analysis to Sec [3.2.5.](#page-12-0)\\n\\nFigure [2](#page-7-1) gives an overview of the five models' \\\"answer sheet\\\" on the math problems. Our merged models retain the foundational knowledge in the source models, as evidenced by the similar score patterns on problems 1–15. Moreover, they exhibit emergent capabilities, successfully tackling problems that stumped the source models (e.g., problems 20–30). Evidently, by effectively integrating a Japanese LLM and mathematical models, we have succeeded in producing models that are proficient in both Japanese language understanding and mathematical problem-solving.\\n\\n![](_page_7_Figure_6.jpeg)\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-7-1\\\"></span>Figure 2: Performance Overview. The figure depicts the success of various models on the MGSM-JA task, with each of the 250 test problems represented along the x-axis by problem ID. Correct answers are indicated by colored markers at the corresponding positions.\\n\\nFurthermore, Table [2](#page-8-0) presents the results of evaluating the general Japanese language ability using the Japanese Language Model Evaluation Harness (JP-LMEH) benchmark suite. This benchmark suite consists of nine tasks, and the average score across these tasks is widely used as an indicator of overall Japanese language proficiency. Our models achieve remarkably high scores of 70.5 and 66.2, surpassing the source models and even the previous state-of-the-art 70B parameter Japanese LLM (specifically, Japanese StableLM 70B), despite having only 7B to 10B parameters.\\n\\nCompared to the source Japanese model (shisa-gamma-7b-v1), it is interesting to note that there is not only a significant improvement in the MGSM scores but also improvements in other tasks such as JSQuAD and JAQKET. However, we also acknowledge that there are certain tasks, such as JNLI and MARC (for DFS), where performance has dropped. It should be noted that the MGSM scores here do not match those in Table [1,](#page-7-0) due to the differences in evaluation protocols (few-shot, prompting, etc.). Additional details are provided in Appendix [A,](#page-21-0) including extensive comparisons with other models in Table [6.](#page-22-0)\\n\\nMoreover, Appendix [C](#page-21-1) showcases intriguing examples that demonstrate the utility of our models merged using evolution. The merged models correctly answered questions that require both knowledge about Japanese-culture *and* Math ability. In contrast, even if such Japanese questions were translated into English and answered in English, English math models would likely fail to provide the correct answers as they may not be aware of Japanese culture-specific context in the questions.\\n\\nTable 2: Breakdown of JP-LMEH Scores for Japanese Language Proficiency.

The optimization was conducted for 1000 trials, and the best trial with respect to the training accuracy was chosen as the final model. We decided to employ TIES-Merging [\\\\[63\\\\]](#page-20-3) with DARE [\\\\[65\\\\]](#page-20-5) through preliminary experiments, and optimized its parameters.\\n\\nIn our DFS merging experiments,  $M = 64$ ,  $r = 3$ , and consequently,  $T = M \\\\times r = 192$ . We kept the last 200 examples in the training data as our validation set and optimize on the rest of the data with a batch size of 200. We report the performance of the snapshot that achieved the highest accuracy in the validation set, and the test set is strictly isolated from the optimization process. We adopted CMA-ES in EvoJAX [\\\\[59\\\\]](#page-20-14), it optimized  $I$  and  $W$  for a total of 100 generations with a popluation size of 128, and we used the default hyper-parameters. We limited our DFS merging to two models A and B to ensure that the final model remains modest in size and can be run on a single GPU, but in principle, the methodology can scale to merging multiple models. During the merging, model A's tokenizer, and input/output embeddings are utilized. Furthermore, to maintain compatibility with the embedding layers, we mandate that the initial and final transformer layers of model A define the start and the end of the inference path. We initialized the indicator array  $I$  so that all layers in model A are more likely to be included as initial hops in the inference path to shorten the search time.\\n\\n#### 3.1.2 Experimental Results\\n\\nTable [1](#page-7-0) summarizes the performance of the LLMs on Japanese Math and overall Japanese benchmark tasks. The MGSM-JA column reports the results from the MGSM test set, employing the previously described metrics. The Japanese language model (Model 1) demonstrates limited mathematical proficiency, while the Math models (Models 2 and 3), though mathematically adept, show insufficient command of the Japanese language. Consequently, all three models score low scores on the MGSM-JA, with accuracy at or below 30.0.\\n\\nTable 1: Performance Comparison of the LLMs. Models 1–3 are source models, Models 4–6 are our optimized merge models, and Models 7–11 are provided for reference.

Notably, the model merged in PS (Model 4) achieves an impressive score of 52.0, highlighting the remarkable potential in combining models with distinct expertises. The DFS-merged model (Model 5) also shows a performance enhancement, with an over 6 percent increase in accuracy compared to the source models. While the leap in performance is not as pronounced as with PS merging, it still proves to be a valid and orthogonal approach. Finally, our hybrid model (Model 6), which integrates both merging strategies, shows further enhancements on the task. The order of the source models in the indicator array  $I$  affects the performance of the DFS merging method.

DFS merged model improves performance on MGSM-JA mainly by shifting the output tokens' distribution to favor Japanese (scenario 1) and helping the LLM better understand the problem (scenario 2). We show the raw outputs from models #2 and #5 in Table [4,](#page-12-1) but have added/removed redundant lines for the purpose of visualization.\\n\\n#### <span id=\\\"page-13-0\\\"></span>3.3 Evolving Japanese VLM\\n\\n#### 3.3.1 Multi-modality Extension\\n\\nWe now extend our method to multi-modal models, and evolve a culturally-specific content aware Japanese VLM. VLMs have recently shown remarkable progress by applying the powerful instructionfollowing capabilities of pre-trained LLMs. The architecture of a VLM generally consists of three components: (1) A vision encoder to extract image features; (2) An LLM to generate text (for the purpose of describing an image); and (3) A projection network to map image features into the LLM's\\n\\nembedding space [\\\\[11,](#page-18-15) [15,](#page-18-16) [35,](#page-19-18) [37,](#page-19-19) [39\\\\]](#page-19-20). Crucially, the LLM component is initialized with powerful pre-trained LLMs for their text generation capabilities. During training, the projection network and optionally the LLM are trained on various vision-language datasets, while the vision encoder is fixed.\\n\\n#### 3.3.2 Experimental Setup\\n\\nSource Models The LLM component inside a VLM can be regarded as a standalone LLM, with the extra capability of understanding visual *soft prompts*. From this perspective, by fixing the vision encoder and the projection network and only focusing on the LLM component, it is straightforward to apply the methodologies detailed in Section [2](#page-4-1) to produce a new LLM with expanded capabilities.\\n\\nIn this experiment, we merge a Japanese LLM and the LLM component in a VLM in the parameter space. We select shisa-gamma-7b-v1 [\\\\[9\\\\]](#page-18-11) as the Japanese LLM and LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B [\\\\[38\\\\]](#page-19-21) as the VLM. Both models are fine-tunes of the Mistral-7B-v0.1 [\\\\[28\\\\]](#page-19-11) base model.\\n\\nDataset To the best of our knowledge, publically accessible Japanese VLM datasets are scarce. In response, we created a new open Japanese VLM benchmark and assessed our VLM on a widely recognized Japanese VQA dataset. Our new benchmark dataset consists of:\\n\\n- JA-VG-VQA-500: A 500-sample test set extracted from the Japanese Visual Genome VQA dataset [\\\\[53\\\\]](#page-20-15).\\n- JA-VLM-Bench-In-the-Wild: A Japanese version of LLaVA-Bench-In-the-Wild [\\\\[39\\\\]](#page-19-20) . We compiled a rich collection of 42 images, accompanied by a total of 50 questions, featuring a variety of Japanese cultural elements and objects found in Japan. The QAs were crafted with the assistance of GPT-4V [\\\\[1\\\\]](#page-18-17) and underwent a human-in-the-loop filtering process to eliminate nonsensical outcomes. Compared to the JA-VG-VQA-500 dataset, our set poses more complex challenges, demanding more nuanced and detailed responses.\\n\\nWe used another subset of the Japanese Visual Genome VQA dataset during the evolutionary search. This subset is not overlapped with examples in the JA-VG-VQA-500 dataset, to avoid leakage in the optimization process.\\n\\nThe images in the JA-VLM-Bench-In-the-Wild dataset, which predominantly represent Japanese content, were carefully selected by native Japanese speakers to minimize the risk of insensitive or biased representations. All images were sourced from Unsplash and are published under the Unsplash license, which ensures that there are no ethical or legal issues with their use. Unsplash contributors agree to obtain necessary permissions from related individuals in their photos before uploading, which addresses potential concerns regarding the use of images containing recognizable humans. Additionally, the captions were generated using GPT-4-V and were meticulously reviewed by human annotators to ensure accuracy and cultural sensitivity. This process aims to create a dataset that is both ethically sourced and culturally appropriate.\\n\\nEvaluation We consider two baselines in our experiments: LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B [\\\\[38\\\\]](#\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Grandma Jones\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Grandma Jones is a character who is involved in cutting pies into pieces for guests.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Pies\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Pies are baked goods that were cut into pieces for serving to guests.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Tokyo\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Tokyo is mentioned as a location in the context of the document but does not have a direct relevance to the entities identified.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Guests\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Guests are individuals who partake in eating the pies that were prepared.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Pieces of Pie\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Pieces of pie refer to the individual servings cut from the original pies for guests.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Grandma Jones\\\"<|>\\\"Pies\\\"<|>\\\"Grandma Jones cut the pies into pieces for the guests to enjoy.\\\"<|>\\\"food preparation, event hosting\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Guests\\\"<|>\\\"Pieces of Pie\\\"<|>\\\"Guests consumed the pieces of pie that were prepared by Grandma Jones.\\\"<|>\\\"food consumption, event participation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"food preparation, event hosting, pie consumption, guests\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\norders are reversed (model #5). This \\\"sub-optimal\\\" behavior is a trade-off between flexibility and search efficiency. In our experiments, we initialize the indicator array  $\\\\mathcal{I}$  with zeros, but set the values of those corresponding to layers in model A in the first repetition at  $2\\\\sigma$  where  $\\\\sigma$  is the initial standard deviation of CMA-ES exploration (recall that in DFS, layers from model A come before those from model B in each repetition). In this way, the merged model behaves just like model A at the beginning of the DFS process, and is allowed to gradually add/remove layers if necessary. Comparing with the other scenario where we initialize I with only zeros, this setting effectively avoids the cases where poor stacking of the layers causes the LLM to output complete nonsense and waste explorations, at the cost of losing the flexibility to automatically swap the order of models in  $\\\\mathcal{I}$ .\\n\\nIn our second ablation study, the difference between models #6 and #7 highlights the importance of the inclusion of the scaling matrix  $W$ . Without scaling, the performance of model #6 is even worse than the PS-merged model, one of its source models. Sufficient as it is in this setting, we wish to point out that this simple scaling treatment does not work if any of the source models has been fine-tuned for a significantly longer time. We suspect that prolonged fine-tuning might lead to increased incompatibility for data traversing through layers from different models. This could be due to permutations in the weight matrices. For example, assuming we are organizing the 4096 dimensions of the hidden states by their absolute values, data from layer 1 in model A might look like (1, 2, ... 4096), but in model B, after extended fine-tuning, it might appear as (4001, 133, 3, ... 989) vs (1.1, 1.9, ..., 4097) when it was only slightly fine-tuned.\\n\\nWhile it is hard to understand thoroughly why DFS merging helped improve performance, we conducted analysis of the merged model (model #5 in Table [4\\\\)](#page-12-1) to get insights. Figure [5](#page-13-1) shows the final hops and scales configuration from the merged model. It is important to notice that we forced the scaling factor  $W\\\\_{i,j} = 1$  if  $j = i + 1$  and layers  $i, j$  are from the same model. This is to prevent the possibility of introducing extra modeling power via  $W$ , in this manner we are certain that all the performance boost comes from layer stacking and permutation. It is interesting and surprising to notice that the DFS-merged model decides to skip layer #30 from MetaMath-13B-V1.0 at the beginning of the inference path. Based on this finding, we removed layer #30 from MetaMath-13B-V1.0, and without any further modifications we found the performance increased to 10%. This implies that DFS merging works because it is able to identify the redundant/harmful operations (with respect to a specific task) embedded in certain layers, and performance increases once these layers are removed.\\n\\n![](_page_13_Figure_0.jpeg)\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-13-1\\\"></span>Figure 5: Evolved Configurations from A DFS-merged 13B model. The style and settings of this plot is identical to that of Figure [4.](#page-9-1) Surprisingly, DFS decides to skip layer #30 from the original model (model #2 in Table [4\\\\)](#page-12-1). If we simply excluded that layer from model #2 and without any further modifications, its performance on MGSM-JA would have increased to 10%. This configuration is from model #5 in Table [4.](#page-12-1)\\n\\nFurthermore, we analyzed the problems where our DFS-merged model answered correctly while the math source model didn't, and we identify mainly two scenarios where DFS helped improve the performance, see Figure [6](#page-13-2) for illustrations from these scenarios. In the first scenario, we found that the English math model was able to reason correctly. However, it outputs the reasoning steps or answers in English, violating the request that the response must be written in Japanese. In this scenario, DFS-merging managed to shift the output tokens' distribution toward Japanese vocabularies, fixing the problem. In the second scenario, the English math model was actually reasoning in Japanese. But due to the error in understanding the Japanese problem or in the reasoning, it was not able to give correct answers. DFS-merging, due to its appending of the layers from the Japanese general model, was able to largely avoid the problem. Unlike the \\\"subtraction\\\" it did previously, these scenarios suggest DFS also works because it is capable of \\\"addition\\\" – finding what is missing in one of the source models and compensate that by adding layers in the inference path from other models.\\n\\n| Scenario 1

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\n. Similarly, for the DFS baseline equivalent (Frankenmerging), we used the same combination of source models as in our DFS experiments, enabling direct comparisons.\\n\\nThe results indicate that TIES-Merge and Frankenmerging led to decreased performance in both MGSM-JA and JP-LMEH, suggesting unsuccessful merging. Notably, Frankenmerging resulted in a MGSM-JA score of 0, which is consistent with its general tendency to often produce models that fail to generate meaningful outputs. DARE-TIES performed relatively better among these baselines, with a slight improvement in MGSM-JA compared to the source models. However, our PS model significantly outperformed all these baselines, and the hybrid merging method (PS+DFS) gives the best test performance on the target task.\\n\\n### 3.2.2 Comparison with Fine-tuning\\n\\nTable [3](#page-10-0) also compares our evolutionary model merging approach with the fine-tuning method. To ensure a fair comparison, we used the identical dataset. Specifically, we utilized the 1069 samples of Japanese-translated GSM8k that were employed in our PS and DFS optimization for fine-tuning the models. We tested learning rates of 1e-5, 5e-5, and 1e-4, choosing the optimal one. We set the number of epochs to 3 and tried both LoRA and full parameter fine-tuning. We experimented with all three source models: shisa-gamma-7b-v1, WizardMath-7B-V1.1, and Abel-7B-002.\\n\\nThe MGSM-JA scores show that while fine-tuning generally improved performance over the original models, the highest score achieved was 43.2. This is notably lower than our proposed method, which exceeded a score of 50. Additionally, unlike our approach, fine-tuning often led to significant decreases in JP-LMEH scores. This suggests that fine-tuning may be more data-hungry and prone to catastrophic forgetting issues.\\n\\nOther potential fine-tuning baselines. Another potential fine-tuning baseline would be combining all data used by all source models to fine-tune a base model. However, this approach is often impractical in general settings, and in our specific case, it is indeed impossible to implement for comparison. We elaborate on these points below. Our proposed approach's strength lies in its ability to freely combine openly published models from platforms like HuggingFace. However, model publishers often only release the models themselves, not the training datasets or detailed\\n\\ntraining methods, as these are considered proprietary knowledge. For instance, the training data for WizardMath-7B-V1.1 and Abel-7B-002 is not publicly available. shisa-gamma-7b-v1 is a further fine-tuned version of japanese-stablelm-base-gamma-7b (which is Mistral-7B-v0.1 fine-tuned for Japanese), and the data used for training japanese-stablelm-base-gamma-7b is also not public. Moreover, the Japanese fine-tuning for japanese-stablelm-base-gamma-7b involved 100B tokens, indicating a substantial computational cost (such as more than 10,000 GPU hours). Therefore, a comparison with this approach is not feasible. It is also worth noting that such fine-tuning would require careful tuning of dataset mixing ratios, which is non-trivial and costly.\\n\\n#### 3.2.3 Impact of Manual Model Selection\\n\\nIn our main experiments, we manually selected three source models. To assess the broader applicability of our approach, it is useful to investigate how sensitive the method is to the selection of source models. To this end, we conducted experiments to measure the distraction effect of including irrelevant models, which simulate the scenario where suboptimal models are inadvertently selected.\\n\\nTo investigate the sensitivity of our method to source model selection, we conducted experiments to measure the distraction effect of including irrelevant models. In addition to our original seed models (shisa-gamma-7b-v1, WizardMath-7B-V1.1, Abel-7B-002), we experimented with one, two, four, and eight irrelevant models, and performed PS experiments to examine the impact on performance. The irrelevant models, chosen for their lack of relation to Japanese or mathematics, were: leo-mistral-hessianai-7b (German), lince-mistral-7b-it-es (Spanish), Mistral-7B-v0.3-Chinese-Chat (Chinese), BioMistral-7B (biomedical domain), Claire-Mistral-7B-0.1 (French), komt-mistral-7b-v1 (Korean), Mistral-7B-v0.1-arabic (Arabic), and Loquace-7B-Mistral (Italy). All these models are openly available on HuggingFace.\\n\\nWe slightly modified the PS optimization by adding weight normalization, which became necessary due to the increased number of models (up to 11 in total). This modification explains why the \\\"+0 irrelevant model\\\" result does not exactly match our original PS result.\\n\\nThe results, shown in the \\\"Distraction\\\" part of Table [3,](#page-10-0) are generally favorable. As expected, using only the initial three models yielded the best results. However, the performance degradation when adding irrelevant models was limited, especially up to four additional models, and even with 8 additional models, the performance did not collapse. This demonstrates that our optimization method is relatively robust to manual source model selection. Due to the huge GPU memory requirement at inference time, the distraction experiments were not conducted for the DFS merging method. We instead present behavior analysis and ablation studies on the topic in the following sections.\\n\\n### 3.2.4 Scaling to Larger Models\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merge\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merge is a model merging approach that was tested for performance against other merging methods in the context of machine learning.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Frankenmerging\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Frankenmerging is another model merging technique that showed decreased performance in the experiments conducted.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DARE-TIES\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"DARE-TIES is a model that performed relatively better in the experiments, showing slight improvements compared to source models.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"PS model\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The PS model is a merging method that significantly outperformed other baselines in the experiments.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MGSM-JA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"MGSM-JA is a scoring metric used to evaluate the performance of models in the experiments.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"JP-LMEH\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"JP-LMEH is another scoring metric used to assess model performance, which was impacted by fine-tuning.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"shisa-gamma-7b-v1\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Shisa-gamma-7b-v1 is a source model used in the merging experiments, fine-tuned for Japanese.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"WizardMath-7B-V1.1\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"WizardMath-7B-V1.1 is a source model included in the experiments, but its training data is not publicly available.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Abel-7B-002\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Abel-7B-002 is a source model utilized in the study, with proprietary training data.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"HuggingFace\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"HuggingFace is a platform where models like shisa-gamma-7b-v1, WizardMath-7B-V1.1, and Abel-7B-002 are published.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese-translated GSM8k\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese-translated GSM8k is the dataset used for fine-tuning the models in the experiments.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merge\\\"<|>\\\"Frankenmerging\\\"<|>\\\"Both TIES-Merge and Frankenmerging were compared in terms of performance in model merging experiments.\\\"<|>\\\"model comparison, performance evaluation\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"DARE-TIES\\\"<|>\\\"PS model\\\"<|>\\\"DARE-TIES performed better than other baseline models, including the PS model, in specific comparisons.\\\"<|>\\\"model performance, comparative analysis\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"PS model\\\"<|>\\\"MGSM-JA\\\"<|>\\\"The PS model achieved a higher MGSM-JA score compared to other models, indicating better performance.\\\"<|>\\\"performance metrics, model evaluation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"shisa-gamma-7b-v1\\\"<|>\\\"HuggingFace\\\"<|>\\\"Shisa-gamma-7b-v1 is available on HuggingFace, which hosts various models for public use.\\\"<|>\\\"model hosting, platform availability\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"JP-LMEH\\\"<|>\\\"fine-tuning\\\"<|>\\\"Fine-tuning often led to significant decreases in JP-LMEH scores, indicating its impact on model performance.\\\"<|>\\\"fine-tuning effects, performance issues\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"model merging, performance evaluation, fine-tuning, machine learning, model comparison\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

However, the performance degradation when adding irrelevant models was limited, especially up to four additional models, and even with 8 additional models, the performance did not collapse. This demonstrates that our optimization method is relatively robust to manual source model selection. Due to the huge GPU memory requirement at inference time, the distraction experiments were not conducted for the DFS merging method. We instead present behavior analysis and ablation studies on the topic in the following sections.\\n\\n### 3.2.4 Scaling to Larger Models\\n\\nFinally, we demonstrate our proposed methods also work with larger models. Concretely, we used fine-tuned versions of Llama-2-13b: ELYZA-japanese-Llama-2-13b-instruct as the Japanese general model and MetaMath-13B-V1.0 as the English math model. All other settings remained identical to the 7B experiments. Due to the limited availability of suitable 13B models, we could only select two source models.\\n\\nThe results are shown in Table [4.](#page-12-1) Similar to the 7B case, the MGSM-JA score significantly improved over both source models. This consistent behavior at the 13B size demonstrates the scalability of our evolutionary model merging approach.\\n\\nThe 7B models achieved higher MGSM-JA scores (52.0, 36.4, 55.2) than the 13B models (31.2, 23.2, 34.0) for (PS, DFS, PS+DFS). This difference is attributed to the source models rather than our proposed method. Mistral-7B-v0.1 is known to outperform Llama-2-13b in performance, especially in basic mathematical abilities, despite its smaller size. This is reflected in the performance of math-specialized models: WizardMath-7B-V1.1 scores 83.2 on GSM8k (an English math benchmark), while MetaMath-13B-V1.0 scores 72.3. This difference explains the performance gap in Japanese math abilities between our merged 7B and 13B models.\\n\\nOn the other hand, our DFS and PS+DFS models (models #4 and #7) achieved higher JP-LMEH average scores than ELYZA-japanese-Llama-2-13b-instruct, the Japanese general model. In general, the qualitative behavior on JP-LMEH is consistent between 7B and 13B models.

Performance comparison and ablation study results on MGSM-JA and JP-LMEH tasks. Rows in gray are ablation studies.\\n\\nof results show improvements in JSQuAD, JAQKET, and MGSM scores, with slight decreases in JNLI and MARC compared to the original Japanese model, indicating similar trends in task-specific score changes (see Table [6\\\\)](#page-22-0).\\n\\n#### <span id=\\\"page-12-0\\\"></span>3.2.5 Analysis on DFS Merging\\n\\nWe included the results from two ablation studies for DFS merging in Table [4,](#page-12-1) and we wish to get insights as to how and why DFS works.\\n\\nComparing models #4 and #5, we show that the order of the source models in DFS merging plays a critical role. Specifically, if we put the layers from the English math model in front of those from the Japanese general model in the indicator array  $\\\\mathcal{I}$  (model #4), the accuracy drops by more than 10 points than the case where the layers orders are reversed (model #5). This \\\"sub-optimal\\\" behavior is a trade-off between flexibility and search efficiency. In our experiments, we initialize the indicator array  $\\\\mathcal{I}$  with zeros, but set the values of those corresponding to layers in model A in the first repetition at  $2\\\\sigma$  where  $\\\\sigma$  is the initial standard deviation of CMA-ES exploration (recall that in DFS, layers from model A come before those from\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Llama-2-13b\\\"<|>\\\"model\\\"<|>\\\"Llama-2-13b is an English general model used for various machine learning tasks, specifically in the context of the study.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"ELYZA-japanese-Llama-2-13b-instruct\\\"<|>\\\"model\\\"<|>\\\"ELYZA-japanese-Llama-2-13b-instruct is a Japanese general model fine-tuned for specific tasks in the Japanese language.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MetaMath-13B-V1.0\\\"<|>\\\"model\\\"<|>\\\"MetaMath-13B-V1.0 is an English math model designed to perform mathematical tasks, utilized in the study for performance comparisons.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Mistral-7B-v0.1\\\"<|>\\\"model\\\"<|>\\\"Mistral-7B-v0.1 is a smaller model known for outperforming Llama-2-13b in basic mathematical abilities.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"WizardMath-7B-V1.1\\\"<|>\\\"model\\\"<|>\\\"WizardMath-7B-V1.1 is a math-specialized model that scored high on the GSM8k benchmark, indicating strong performance in math tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MGSM-JA\\\"<|>\\\"metric\\\"<|>\\\"MGSM-JA is a scoring metric used to evaluate the performance of the models in the study.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"JP-LMEH\\\"<|>\\\"metric\\\"<|>\\\"JP-LMEH is another scoring metric that assesses the performance of models specifically in Japanese language tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DFS Merging\\\"<|>\\\"method\\\"<|>\\\"DFS Merging is an approach used in the study to combine different models for improved performance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"PS+DFS\\\"<|>\\\"method\\\"<|>\\\"PS+DFS is a method combining different model architectures to achieve better results in machine learning tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Llama-2-13b\\\"<|>\\\"MGSM-JA\\\"<|>\\\"Llama-2-13b's performance is evaluated using the MGSM-JA scoring metric, reflecting its effectiveness in English tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"performance evaluation, model scoring\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"ELYZA-japanese-Llama-2-13b-instruct\\\"<|>\\\"JP-LMEH\\\"<|>\\\"The performance of ELYZA-japanese-Llama-2-13b-instruct is assessed using the JP-LMEH metric, indicating its effectiveness in Japanese tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"performance evaluation, model scoring\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"MetaMath-13B-V1.0\\\"<|>\\\"MGSM-JA\\\"<|>\\\"MetaMath-13B-V1.0's performance is also evaluated using the MGSM-JA metric, focusing on its capabilities in math tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"performance evaluation, model scoring\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Mistral-7B-v0.1\\\"<|>\\\"Llama-2-13b\\\"<|>\\\"Mistral-7B-v0.1 outperforms Llama-2-13b in basic mathematical abilities, showcasing a comparative analysis between the two models.\\\"<|>\\\"model comparison, performance analysis\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"WizardMath-7B-V1.1\\\"<|>\\\"MGSM-JA\\\"<|>\\\"WizardMath-7B-V1.1 achieves a high score on the GSM8k benchmark, indicating its strong performance in math-related tasks.\\\"<|>\\\"performance evaluation, model scoring\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"DFS Merging\\\"<|>\\\"PS+DFS\\\"<|>\\\"DFS Merging is a method that is part of the PS+DFS approach, combining models for enhanced performance.\\\"<|>\\\"methodology, model integration\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"model performance, machine learning, evaluation metrics, model merging, comparative analysis\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nnovel ways to merge different models from vastly different domains (e.g., non-English language and Math, or non-English language and Vision), in non-trivial ways that might be difficult for human experts to discover themselves.\\n\\nTo test our approach, we apply our method to automatically create a Japanese LLM capable of Math reasoning, and a culturally-specific content aware Japanese VLM. Surprisingly, we find that both models achieve state-of-the-art results on several LLM and Vision benchmarks, while not being explicitly optimized to be good at these benchmarks, attaining the top performance on a vast array of other Japanese LLM benchmarks, even exceeding the performance of some previous SOTA 70B parameter Japanese LLMs.\\n\\nWith these promising initial results, we believe we are just scratching the surface of unlocking the full capabilities of evolutionary model merging, and this is the inception of a long-term development of applying evolutionary principles to foundation model development.\\n\\nCurrently, we are already achieving promising results in applying evolutionary model merging to image diffusion models, enabling the creation of high performance cross-domain image generation models by merging existing building blocks in novel ways discovered by evolution.\\n\\nThe method currently requires the user to select a set of source models to use as ingredients for evolutionary search. We believe it is also possible to leverage evolution to search for candidate source models from a vast population of existing models as well. In addition to model selection, we are also exploring using evolution to produce swarms of diverse foundation models each with\\n\\nits own niche and behaviors. This holds the potential of enabling the emergence of a collective intelligence consisting of a swarm of models capable of self-improvement by continuously producing new complementary internal models of the world through interaction.\\n\\nRelated to our work is an experiment, called Automerger [\\\\[33\\\\]](#page-19-22), released at around the same time as this work. This interesting experiment works by selecting two random models from the top 20 models on the Open LLM Leaderboard [\\\\[26\\\\]](#page-19-1) and randomly apply SLERP [\\\\[60\\\\]](#page-20-2) or DARE-TIES [\\\\[63,](#page-20-3) [65\\\\]](#page-20-5) to create new models. Over time, some of these models will do well, or even better on the benchmark tasks that define this leaderboard, becoming part of the leaderboard. We predict this approach will lead to combinations of the merged models that overfit to the benchmark tasks defined on the leaderboard. The author acknowledged that the idea behind this project was less about creating better models, but more about getting more metrics to help derive a more principled approach to model merging.\\n\\nOur work takes an orthogonal approach of optimizing for tasks outside of the domain specified by the original leaderboard [\\\\[26\\\\]](#page-19-1), rather than being confined by it. As we have shown, surprisingly, stepping away from optimizing for a particular benchmark occasionally results in even greater generalization to numerous other benchmark tasks that we had not intended to optimize for, and such emergent generalization might be the key to unlocking the next great advancements in AI.\\n\\nThe ability to evolve new models with new emergent capabilities, from a large variety of existing, diverse models with various capabilities have important implications. With the rising costs and resource requirement for training foundation models, by leveraging the rich variety of foundation models in the rich open-source ecosystem, large institutions or governments may consider the cheaper evolutionary approach for developing proof-of-concept prototype models quickly, before committing substantial capital or tapping into the nation's resources to develop entirely custom models from scratch, if that is even needed at all.\\n\\nFurther Applications and Impact. After the release of the preprint version of this paper, researchers have explored evolutionary model merging in different domains, highlighting the method's versatility and effectiveness. A notable example is EvoSDXL [\\\\[2\\\\]](#page-18-18), which applied evolutionary model merging to diffusion image generation models. This proves that our method works well not just for LLMs and VLMs, but for other types of models as well. Moreover, what makes EvoSDXL particularly interesting is its success in merging SDXL-Lightning [\\\\[36\\\\]](#page-19-23) with other standard SDXL fine-tunes. SDXL-Lightning is a specialized variant of SDXL that employs an adversarial loss during training, enabling rapid image generation in just a few steps, compared to the 50 or 100 steps typically required by standard diffusion models. The evolutionary model merging technique effectively combined this unique model with conventional SDXL fine-tunes, despite the different protocols used in their development. This success illustrates that our method is capable of integrating models created through varying protocols, combining their strengths to create more robust and powerful models. Additionally, other unique models such as EvoVLM-JP-v2 [\\\\[4\\\\]](#page-18-19) and EvoUkiyoe [\\\\[3\\\\]](#page-18-20) have also been developed using evolutionary model merging, further demonstrating the method's potential and adaptability. Moreover, after the publication of the preprint, evolutionary model merging was implemented in two famous open-source software packages, MergeKit [\\\\[21\\\\]](#page-18-0) and Optuna Hub [\\\\[8\\\\]](#page-18-14). It has become widely available to many people, is being used practically, and further possibilities are being explored.\\n\\nLimitations. We acknowledge that although our evolutionary model merging effectively integrates diverse expertise from the source models, it also inherits their limitations. For instance, we encountered instances where the merged models produced responses that lacked logical coherence. Additionally, this study does not encompass instruction fine-tuning or alignment, raising the potential for the models to yield outputs that may be factually flawed.\\n\\nAuthor Contributions.

We acknowledge that although our evolutionary model merging effectively integrates diverse expertise from the source models, it also inherits their limitations. For instance, we encountered instances where the merged models produced responses that lacked logical coherence. Additionally, this study does not encompass instruction fine-tuning or alignment, raising the potential for the models to yield outputs that may be factually flawed.\\n\\nAuthor Contributions. Takuya Akiba initiated the \\\"Evolutionary Optimization of Model Merging Recipes\\\" project, wrote the project design document, and initiated the parameter space model merging experiments, laying the groundwork for the methodology. Makoto Shing expanded the parameter space model merging to encompass vision-language models and diffusion models. Yujin Tang directed the efforts in data flow space model merging by incorporating ideas and methods inspired from the neural architecture search and morphology evolution literature, establishing foundational methods in this domain and in hybrid merging strategies. Qi Sun contributed to the implementation of our parameter space model merging framework and assisted in model evaluation. David Ha provided overarching guidance for the research project, offering technical insight, advice, feedback and writing. Ethical and Societal Impact. Evolutionary model merging offers significant positive societal impacts by enabling the creation of small yet highly capable models at lower costs. This approach democratizes access to advanced AI capabilities, potentially reducing the environmental footprint of AI development and deployment. By efficiently combining existing models, it can lead to more accessible and versatile AI solutions, particularly benefiting regions and languages with limited resources. However, as with other model development techniques, this approach may present certain considerations. The combination of diverse models could potentially lead to unexpected behaviors or biases, and the complexity of merged models might affect their interpretability. While these challenges are common in AI development, they underscore the importance of continued research and evaluation. It's worth noting that the models and techniques presented in this work serve primarily as a proof of concept. For applications in mission-critical scenarios or models intended for wide public use, further verification and refinement of the methodology may be necessary. This ongoing improvement process is crucial for realizing the full potential of evolutionary model merging while ensuring responsible and ethical deployment.\\n\\n## Data Availability Statement\\n\\nAll datasets used in this paper are publicly available.

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nplash contributors agree to obtain necessary permissions from related individuals in their photos before uploading, which addresses potential concerns regarding the use of images containing recognizable humans. Additionally, the captions were generated using GPT-4-V and were meticulously reviewed by human annotators to ensure accuracy and cultural sensitivity. This process aims to create a dataset that is both ethically sourced and culturally appropriate.\\n\\nEvaluation We consider two baselines in our experiments: LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B [\\\\[38\\\\]](#page-19-21), one of our source models, and Japanese Stable VLM [\\\\[54\\\\]](#page-20-16) a Japanese VLM trained from scratch on Japanese datasets.\\n\\nAll models adopt the same generation configurations, with deterministic decoding. We compute ROUGE-L with a Japanese language detector to replace non-Japanese responses with empty texts, resulting in a score of zero for non-Japanese responses. To be consistent with our LLM experiments in Section [3.1,](#page-6-0) we also employed fasttext [\\\\[29,](#page-19-16) [30\\\\]](#page-19-17) for this language detection task. However, we made an exception for cases where the ground-truth answer itself contains non-Japanese but commonly seen words in Japanese texts (e.g., a widely recognized acronym such as \\\"UFO\\\"). In these instances, non-Japanese responses from models are not converted to empty texts.\\n\\nOptimization We use the identical settings as the earlier LLM merging experiments in Section [3.1.](#page-6-0) Concretely, we use TIES-Merging with DARE for merging the source models in the parameter space. For merging in the data flow space, we treat LlaVa 1.6 Mistral 7B as our model A and shisa-gamma-7b-v1 as model B. For PS+DFS, our PS-merged model is model A and shisa-gamma-7b-v1 is model B.\\n\\n### 3.3.3 Experimental Results\\n\\nTable [5](#page-15-0) compares the performance of our VLM with the baselines. Please note that the Japanese Stable VLM cannot be evaluated on JA-VG-VQA-500 because it was trained on this dataset.\\n\\nOur merged VLMs' enhanced performance on the JA-VG-VQA-500 benchmark indicates their proficiency in Japanese, highlighting the successful integration of the source Japanese LLM with the LLM component of the original VLM through evolutionary merging. Consistent with the findings we show in the previous discussions, simple merging without evolutionary search do not give strong performance as ours, see the last 3 rows in Table [5.](#page-15-0) Furthermore, our models' superior results on the JA-VLM-Bench-In-the-Wild compared to both baselines exhibits its adeptness at navigating culturally-specific content.\\n\\nBesides the quantitative results in Table [5,](#page-15-0) we qualitatively compare our VLM with the baseline models in Appendix [C.](#page-21-1) Our evolved model is able to handle Japanese culture-specific content remarkably well, generally producing more detailed responses with correct information.\\n\\nTable 5: Performance Comparison of the VLMs. LLaVA 1.6 Mistral 7B is the source VLM and Japanese Stable VLM is an open-sourced Japanese VLM. While JA-VG-VQA-500 measures general VQA abilities in Japanese, JA-VLM-Bench-In-the-Wild evaluates the model's handling of complex VQA tasks within Japanese cultural contexts.\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-15-0\\\"></span>\\n\\n| Model                | Size | JA-VG-VQA-500<br>(ROUGE-L ↑) | JA-VLM-Bench-In-the-Wild<br>(ROUGE-L ↑) |\\n|----------------------|------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\\n| LLaVA 1.6 Mistral 7B | 8B   | 14.3                         | 41.1                                    |\\n| Japanese Stable VLM  | 8B   | -                            | 40.5                                    |\\n| Ours (PS)            | 8B   | 19.7                         | 51.2                                    |\\n| Ours (DFS)           | 12B  | 16.8                         | 46.5                                    |\\n| Ours (PS+DFS)        | 11B  | 20.4                         | 47.6                                    |\\n| TIES [63]            | 8B   | 16.0                         | 46.5                                    |\\n| DARE-TIES [65]       | 8B   | 9.4                          | 36.0                                    |\\n| Passthrough [21]     | 9B   | 7.3                          | 26.7                                    |\\n\\n## 4 Discussion\\n\\nIn this report, we propose a general method that uses evolutionary techniques to efficiently discover the best ways to combine different models from the vast ocean of different open-source models with diverse capabilities. By working with the vast collective intelligence of existing open models, our method is able to automatically create new foundation models with desired capabilities specified by the user. We find that our approach is able to automatically discover novel ways to merge different models from vastly different domains (e.g., non-English language and Math, or non-English language and Vision), in non-trivial ways that might be difficult for human experts to discover themselves.\\n\\nTo test our approach, we apply our method to automatically create a Japanese LLM capable of Math reasoning, and a culturally-specific content aware Japanese VLM. Surprisingly, we find that both models achieve state-of-the-art results on several LLM and Vision benchmarks, while not being explicitly optimized\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"GPT-4-V\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"GPT-4-V is an advanced AI model used for generating captions and processing images in a culturally sensitive manner.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B is a source model used in experiments for generating visual language models.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese Stable VLM\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese Stable VLM is an open-sourced visual language model trained on Japanese datasets.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"JA-VG-VQA-500\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"JA-VG-VQA-500 is a benchmark dataset used to evaluate visual question answering abilities in Japanese.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"JA-VLM-Bench-In-the-Wild\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"JA-VLM-Bench-In-the-Wild is a benchmark that assesses the performance of models on complex visual question answering tasks within Japanese cultural contexts.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging is a method used for merging different models in the parameter space to enhance performance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DARE\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"DARE is a technique utilized for merging models in the data flow space, aiming to improve model capabilities.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Fasttext\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Fasttext is a library used for language detection tasks in the experiments.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"GPT-4-V\\\"<|>\\\"LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B\\\"<|>\\\"GPT-4-V is utilized in conjunction with LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B to generate captions and improve model outputs.\\\"<|>\\\"model collaboration, caption generation\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese Stable VLM\\\"<|>\\\"LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B serves as a source model for the Japanese Stable VLM, influencing its training process.\\\"<|>\\\"model training, source influence\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"JA-VG-VQA-500\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese Stable VLM\\\"<|>\\\"The Japanese Stable VLM cannot be evaluated on the JA-VG-VQA-500 dataset because it was trained on this dataset.\\\"<|>\\\"evaluation limitation, dataset training\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"JA-VLM-Bench-In-the-Wild\\\"<|>\\\"Japanese Stable VLM\\\"<|>\\\"The performance of the Japanese Stable VLM on the JA-VLM-Bench-In-the-Wild demonstrates its ability to handle culturally-specific content.\\\"<|>\\\"cultural context, model performance\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging\\\"<|>\\\"DARE\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging and DARE are both methods employed for merging models to enhance their capabilities.\\\"<|>\\\"model merging, optimization techniques\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Fasttext\\\"<|>\\\"LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B\\\"<|>\\\"Fasttext is used for language detection in the context of LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B experiments.\\\"<|>\\\"language detection, experimental methodology\\\"<|>5)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"AI models, visual language processing, Japanese datasets, model merging techniques, cultural sensitivity\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

it according to their convention. This configuration is widely used and compatible with the results on their report [\\\\[5\\\\]](#page-18-23) and Rinna leaderboards [\\\\[49\\\\]](#page-20-17), thus allowing direct comparison of scores with a large number of Japanese LLMs.\\n\\nTable [6](#page-22-0) is the full version of Table [2,](#page-8-0) allowing for comparisons between our models and a wider range of models. Some of the numbers are from the Stability AI Japan report and the Rinna leaderboard. Despite having only 7B to 10B parameters, our models achieve higher scores than all existing <70B parameters models and exhibit scores on par with the SOTA 70B models.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-21-2\\\"></span>B Evolving for License Specific Open-Source Models\\n\\nIn the main section, our EvoLLM-JP results were evolved using models found on HuggingFace. However, some of the models uses, in particular, WizardMath-7B-V1.1 [\\\\[40\\\\]](#page-19-15) has been released under a Non-Commercial, Research-only, Microsoft License, which is not *truly* open-source. Therefore, our release of EvoLLM-JP is also released under a Non-Commercial, Research-only License to be consistent with the WizardMath-7B-V1.1 model.\\n\\nAs researchers who benefited from the open-source community, we would like for models that we release to also be under an open-source license. In the spirit of open-source, and to showcase the applicability of our method to tackle even challenging issues like model licenses. We have ran a similar experiment where we incorporated *only* models that have been released under a true opensource license, such as MIT or Apache 2.0, and have produced a similar performing model called EvoLLM-JP-A, which we will release under Apache 2.0. This model will also be released on our GitHub: <https://github.com/SakanaAI/>.\\n\\nSpecifically, our EvoLLM-JP-A is a merge of shisa-gamma-7b-v1, Arithmo2-Mistral-7B, and Abel-7B-002, all of which are under MIT or Apache 2.0 License. The MGSM-JA score measured using the protocol described in Section [3.1](#page-6-0) is 52.4, and the Japanese Language Model Evaluation Harness score is 69.0. We have included results of this Apache 2.0-licensed model for comparison in Table [6,](#page-22-0) which provides a more comprehensive comparison than Table [2](#page-8-0) in the main text.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-21-1\\\"></span>C Case Study\\n\\nTable [7](#page-24-0) provides an example of responses to a mathematical question by existing models and our model. By merging a Japanese language model, we not only improve our capability to understand and use Japanese in reading and writing but also expand our knowledge about Japan. This example requires both mathematical reasoning and Japanese-specific knowledge, specifically that Setsubun is the day before the beginning of spring (Risshun). Notably, only our merged model provides the correct answer. Even when the question is translated into English, the English math model WizardMath-7B-V1.1 fails to answer correctly, demonstrating that our merged model is superior to a combination of machine translation and an English math model.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that in Table [7,](#page-24-0) we also provide the answer from the general-purpose math model WizardMath-7B-V1.1 with the question translated into English. However, even with the translated question, WizardMath-7B-V1.1 fails to provide the correct answer. This highlights the fact that simply translating the question is not sufficient to solve the problem, as it also requires an understanding of the Japanese cultural context. Even if one were to consider a combination of machine translation and an English math model as an alternative approach, it would still fall short in capturing the nuances and context-specific knowledge required to answer the question correctly. This demonstrates the unique value of our merged model, which effectively combines mathematical reasoning capabilities with Japanese language understanding and cultural knowledge.\\n\\nTable 6: Breakdown of JP-LMEH Scores for Japanese Language Proficiency (Full Version of Table [2\\\\)](#page-8-0).

extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name.\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,category]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\nFormat the content-level key words as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n5.

failed to solve a problem correctly, using a question from the MGSM test set. The problem involved calculating the internal volume of boxes. When presented in Japanese, all models encountered difficulties in correctly accounting for the wall thickness. EvoLLM-JP-v1-7B attempted to adjust for it but made an arithmetic error, leading to an incorrect volume of 351 cubic inches. shisa-gamma-7b-v1 ignored the wall thickness entirely, calculating the external dimensions only, and thus arrived at 360 cubic inches. WizardMath-7B-V1.1 recognized the need for an adjustment but applied it incorrectly, resulting in 288 cubic inches. Notably, when the original English problem was presented to WizardMath-7B-V1.1, it produced the correct answer of 72 cubic inches. This suggests that there may still be some loss in transferring the model's high mathematical reasoning abilities from English to Japanese.\\n\\nAdditionally, Table [9](#page-26-0) provides the case studies for our VLM. We observe that our VLM successfully obtained knowledge, cultural understanding, and fluency in Japanese expression of the Japanese LLM.\\n\\nThe first example features a photo of Koi-nobori, a cultural tradition specific to Japan. LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B, lacking sufficient knowledge of Japanese culture, failed to answer Koinobori correctly. In contrast, both Japanese-Stable-VLM and EvoVLM-JP, possessing knowledge of Japanese culture, successfully identified the Koi-nobori. Notably, EvoVLM-JP's response demonstrates greater fluency in its explanation.\\n\\nThe third example involves a question about the color of traffic lights. In Japan, the green traffic light is called \\\"blue\\\" because historically, the word \\\"blue\\\" referred to a range of colors, including blue and green, and also because the initial traffic lights used in Japan had a bluish-green hue, leading to the continuation of this terminology today. EvoVLM-JP is the only model that correctly identifies the traffic light color as \\\"blue\\\" in Japanese, demonstrating its accurate understanding of this cultural and linguistic nuance. LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B consistently but incorrectly labels the light as \\\"green\\\" in Japanese, revealing its lack of specific cultural knowledge. Japanese-Stable-VLM shows inconsistent responses, alternating between \\\"green,\\\" \\\"green and white,\\\" and \\\"white,\\\" indicating confusion. These results highlight EvoVLM-JP's superior grasp of Japanese language conventions and cultural context in this specific scenario.\\n\\nTable 7: Case Study of EvoLLM-JP-v1-7B.

The volume of a box is calculated by multiplying its length,<br>width, and height. In this case, the dimensions of the box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. So, the<br>volume of one box is 5 inches * 6 inches * 4 inches = 120 cubic inches.<br>Step 2: Calculate the total volume of all boxes. John has 3 boxes, so the total volume of all boxes is 3<br>boxes * 120 cubic inches/box = 360 cubic inches.<br>Step 3: Adjust for the thickness of the walls. The walls of the boxes add an extra inch to each dimension,<br>so we need to subtract the volume of the walls from the total volume of the boxes. The volume of the<br>walls of one box is 1 inch * 6 inches * 4 inches = 24 cubic inches. Since there are 3 boxes, the total<br>volume of the walls is 3 boxes * 24 cubic inches/box = 72 cubic inches.<br>Step 4: Subtract the volume of the walls from the total volume of the boxes. The adjusted total volume<br>of the boxes is 360 cubic inches - 72 cubic inches = 288 cubic inches.<br>So, the total volume of the contents of the 3 boxes is 288 cubic inches.<br>The answer is: 288 cubic inches.                                                                                                                                                     |  |\\n| WizardMath-7B-V1.1<br>EN Instruction | John has 3 boxes.

So, the inner dimensions will<br>be:<br>- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches - Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches - Height: 4 inches - 2<br>inches = 2 inches<br>Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box by multiplying the inner dimensions:<br>Inner Volume = Length × Width × Height Inner Volume = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches Inner<br>Volume = 24 cubic inches<br>Since John has 3 boxes, we need to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:<br>Total Inner Volume = Inner Volume of one box × Number of boxes Total Inner Volume = 24 cubic<br>inches × 3 Total Inner Volume = 72 cubic inches<br>So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.<br>The answer is: 72.                                                                                                                                                                               |  |\\n\\nTable 8: Case Study of EvoLLM-JP-v1-7B.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\\n\\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \\\"If this tech can be understood...\\\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \\\"It could change the game for us.

their diverse capabilities. Existing model merging methods are often constrained by fixed parameter merging ratios. In this study, we propose Mixup Model Merge (M<sup>3</sup>), an innovative approach inspired by the Mixup data augmentation technique. This method merges the parameters of two large language models (LLMs) by randomly generating linear interpolation ratios, allowing for a more flexible and comprehensive exploration of the parameter space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed M<sup>3</sup> method in merging fine-tuned LLMs: (1) it significantly improves performance across multiple tasks, (2) it enhances LLMs' out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness and adversarial robustness, (3) it achieves superior results when combined with sparsification techniques such as DARE, and (4) it offers a simple yet efficient solution that does not require additional computational resources. In conclusion, M<sup>3</sup> is a simple yet effective model merging method that significantly enhances the performance of the merged model by randomly generating contribution ratios for two fine-tuned LLMs. The code is available at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/MixupModelMerge) [MLGroupJLU/MixupModelMerge](https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/MixupModelMerge).\\n\\n### 1 Introduction\\n\\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the emergence of large language models (LLMs) [\\\\(Brown et al.,](#page-8-0) [2020;](#page-8-0) [Touvron et al.,](#page-9-0) [2023;](#page-9-0) [OpenAI,](#page-9-1) [2023;](#page-9-1) [Chowdhery et al.,](#page-8-1) [2023\\\\)](#page-8-1) represents a revolutionary breakthrough.

However, SFT requires substantial computational resources and long training times [\\\\(Brown](#page-8-0) [et al.,](#page-8-0) [2020;](#page-8-0) [Chang et al.,](#page-8-6) [2024a\\\\)](#page-8-6). To address this\\n\\n<sup>\\\\*</sup>Corresponding authors\\n\\nchallenge, Model Merging has emerged as an efficient solution, fusing the parameters of multiple fine-tuned LLMs into a unified model with diverse capabilities, without the need for additional training or computational costs [\\\\(Yang et al.,](#page-10-2) [2024;](#page-10-2) [Ak](#page-8-7)[iba et al.,](#page-8-7) [2024\\\\)](#page-8-7). It effectively reduces the resourceintensive demands of SFT while preserving and even enhancing model performance.\\n\\nA simple analogy for model merging is the Super Mario game, where the protagonist gains special abilities by absorbing power-up items. Similarly, merging model parameters integrates the strengths of different models, enabling more effective multi-task learning [\\\\(Yu et al.,](#page-10-3) [2024\\\\)](#page-10-3). However, existing model merging methods have some limitations, these methods heavily rely on predefined or heuristic parameter fusion strategies [\\\\(Wortsman](#page-9-4) [et al.,](#page-9-4) [2022;](#page-9-4) [Ilharco et al.,](#page-9-5) [2022;](#page-9-5) [Matena and Raf](#page-9-6)[fel,](#page-9-6) [2022;](#page-9-6) [Jin et al.,](#page-9-7) [2022;](#page-9-7) [Yadav et al.,](#page-10-4) [2023;](#page-10-4) [Yu](#page-10-3) [et al.,](#page-10-3) [2024\\\\)](#page-10-3) such that they fail to fully explore the parameter space, thereby restricting the potential of the merged model.\\n\\nTo address this issue, we draw inspiration from Mixup [\\\\(Zhang,](#page-10-5) [2017\\\\)](#page-10-5) and propose a novel technique called Mixup Model Merge (M<sup>3</sup>). This method introduces randomness by dynamically adjusting the contribution ratios between models, making the model merging process more flexible and enabling a thorough exploration of the parameter space. M<sup>3</sup> further unlocks the potential of model merging, significantly enhancing the generalization performance of the merged model while improving its out-of-distribution (OOD) and adversarial robustness [\\\\(Wang et al.,](#page-9-8) [2023;](#page-9-8) [Zhu et al.,](#page-10-6) [2023\\\\)](#page-10-6). As shown in Figure [2,](#page-2-0) the implementation of M<sup>3</sup> is similar to the process of proportionally mixing magical potions in *Harry Potter*. Specifically, this method dynamically controls the parameter fusion ratio between two fine-tuned LLMs by randomly generating a linear interpolation ratio  $\\\\lambda\\\\_m$ , where  $\\\\lambda\\\\_m \\\\in (0, 1)$  and  $\\\\lambda\\\\_m \\\\sim Beta(\\\\alpha, \\\\alpha)$ . By adjusting the parameter  $\\\\alpha$ , we can precisely control the distribution of  $\\\\lambda\\\\_m$ , allowing M<sup>3</sup> to explore the parameter space of model merging more deeply and thus fully unleash the potential of the models, leading to improved overall performance.\\n\\nWe conducted extensive experiments with three fine-tuned LLMs: WizardLM-13B [\\\\(Xu et al.,](#page-10-7) [2024\\\\)](#page-10-7), WizardMath-13B [\\\\(Luo et al.,](#page-9-9) [2023\\\\)](#page-9-9), and llama-2-13b-code-alpaca [\\\\(Chaudhary,](#page-8-8) [2023\\\\)](#page-8-8), which specialize in instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation, respec-\\n\\ntively. Inspired by Mixup's effectiveness in enhancing the robustness of neural networks when handling corrupted labels or adversarial examples [\\\\(Zhang,](#page-10-5) [2017\\\\)](#page-10-5), we further performed comprehensive evaluations on LiveBench [\\\\(White et al.,](#page-9-10) [2024\\\\)](#page-9-10) and PromptBench [\\\\(Zhu et al.,](#page-10-8) [2024\\\\)](#page-10-8) to validate the potential of M<sup>3</sup> in improving the OOD robustness and adversarial robustness of merged models.

in improving the OOD robustness and adversarial robustness of merged models. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed M<sup>3</sup> method can significantly improve merged models' performance across various tasks (as shown in Figure [1a\\\\)](#page-0-0), enhance the OOD and adversarial robustness of the merged models (as shown in Figure [1b\\\\)](#page-0-0), and boost model merging when combined with sparsification techniques like DARE [\\\\(Yu et al.,](#page-10-3) [2024\\\\)](#page-10-3) (as shown in Figure [1c\\\\)](#page-0-0).\\n\\n### 2 Related Works\\n\\nModel Merging Model merging is a technique that integrates the parameters of multiple models to create a unified model with enhanced or diverse capabilities [\\\\(Wortsman et al.,](#page-9-4) [2022;](#page-9-4) [Ilharco et al.,](#page-9-5) [2022;](#page-9-5) [Matena and Raffel,](#page-9-6) [2022;](#page-9-6) [Jin et al.,](#page-9-7) [2022;](#page-9-7) [Yadav et al.,](#page-10-4) [2023;](#page-10-4) [Yu et al.,](#page-10-3) [2024;](#page-10-3) [Lin et al.,](#page-9-11) [2024\\\\)](#page-9-11). Task arithmetic [\\\\(Ilharco et al.,](#page-9-5) [2022\\\\)](#page-9-5) leverages task vectors for model merging through arithmetic operations, incorporating a predefined scaling term to weight the contribution of different models. Fisher Merging [\\\\(Matena and Raffel,](#page-9-6) [2022\\\\)](#page-9-6) performs parameter fusion by applying weights derived from the Fisher information matrix [\\\\(Fisher,](#page-8-9) [1922\\\\)](#page-8-9), resulting in more precise parameter integration. TIES-Merging [\\\\(Yadav et al.,](#page-10-4) [2023\\\\)](#page-10-4) addresses task conflicts by removing low-magnitude parameters, resolving sign disagreements, and merging only the parameters that align with the final agreed-upon sign. In [\\\\(Yu et al.,](#page-10-3) [2024\\\\)](#page-10-3), it is found that LLMs can enhance their capabilities through model merging. Additionally, it introduces DARE, a method for sparsifying the delta parameters of the model [\\\\(Ilharco et al.,](#page-9-5) [2022\\\\)](#page-9-5), significantly improving the performance of various model merging techniques.\\n\\nMixup Mixup is proposed to enhance the generalization ability of deep learning models by surpassing traditional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) [\\\\(Zhang,](#page-10-5) [2017\\\\)](#page-10-5). It is a simple, data-agnostic augmentation technique that trains models using virtual examples created by linearly interpolating pairs of random examples and their corresponding labels. Rooted in the Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) principle [\\\\(Chapelle et al.,](#page-8-10) [2000\\\\)](#page-8-10), this ap-\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-2-0\\\"></span>![](_page_2_Figure_0.jpeg)\\n\\nFigure 2: Implementation of m<sup>3</sup>: A process analogous to proportionally mixing magical potions in harry potter. The proposed method controls the contribution ratio between two fine-tuned llms by randomly generating a linear interpolation ratio  $\\\\lambda\\\\_m$ , where  $\\\\lambda\\\\_m \\\\in (0, 1)$  and  $\\\\lambda\\\\_m \\\\sim Beta(\\\\alpha, \\\\alpha)$ .

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\n5), which is defined as the difference between the parameters of the language models (LMs) before and after SFT, i.e.,  $\\\\delta^t = \\\\theta^t\\\\_{SFT} - \\\\theta\\\\_{PRE} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d$ , where t refers to task t.\\n\\nWhen introducing M<sup>3</sup>, the process for Average Merging is reformulated as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\theta\\\\_M = \\\\lambda\\\\_m \\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\rm SFT}^{t\\\\_1} + (1 - \\\\lambda\\\\_m) \\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\rm SFT}^{t\\\\_2}, \\\\qquad (4)\\n$$\\n\\nwhile the process for Task Arithmetic is reformulated as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\theta\\\\_M = \\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\text{PRE}} + \\\\lambda\\\\_m \\\\delta^{t\\\\_1} + (1 - \\\\lambda\\\\_m) \\\\delta^{t\\\\_2}, \\\\quad (5)\\n$$\\n\\nwhere  $\\\\lambda\\\\_m$  determines the linear interpolation ratio between the two fine-tuned LLMs, and is generally a value between 0 and 1.  $\\\\lambda\\\\_m$  is sampled from a Beta distribution, typically  $\\\\lambda\\\\_m \\\\sim Beta(\\\\alpha, \\\\alpha)$ , where  $\\\\alpha$  controls the shape of the Beta distribution.\\n\\nThe hyperparameter  $\\\\alpha$  for M<sup>3</sup> is selected from the range [0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5]. As shown in Figure [3:](#page-3-0) (1) When  $\\\\alpha = 1$ ,  $\\\\lambda$  follows a uniform distribution, meaning all values within the range (0, 1) are equally likely to be sampled. (2) When  $\\\\alpha < 1$ , the distribution of λ exhibits a bimodal shape, with higher probabilities near the extremes (0 and 1). This indicates that the merged model is more likely to be dominated by one of the two models. (3) When  $\\\\alpha > 1$ , the distribution of  $\\\\lambda$  becomes concentrated around the middle (e.g., 0.5), resulting in more balanced contributions from both models.\\n\\n#### 3.3 Theoretical Analysis\\n\\nMixup performs linear interpolations between data samples and their labels in the data space [\\\\(Zhang,](#page-10-5) [2017\\\\)](#page-10-5). Similarly, M<sup>3</sup> can be viewed as applying random linear interpolation in the parameter space, where the interpolation occurs between the parameters of two fine-tuned models trained on different tasks. M<sup>3</sup> represents a natural extension of the Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) principle [\\\\(Chapelle et al.,](#page-8-10) [2000\\\\)](#page-8-10) into the model parameter\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-3-0\\\"></span>![](_page_3_Figure_11.jpeg)\\n\\nFigure 3: The Beta distribution visualization for different α values.\\n\\nspace. In data space, VRM introduces a vicinal distribution to simulate the true data distribution, thereby increasing the diversity of training data and enhancing the model's generalization ability. Similarly, M<sup>3</sup> extends this principle by constructing a virtual neighborhood in the model parameter space between two task-specific models, combining their knowledge in a way that is more natural and balanced.\\n\\nIn the context of model merging, interpolating between two sets of model parameters,  $\\\\theta^{t\\\\_1}\\\\_{SFT}$  and  $\\\\theta^{t\\\\_2}\\\\_{SFT}$ , defines a new neighborhood distribution in the parameter space, which can be expressed as:\\n\\n$$\\\\begin{split} P\\\\_{\\\\nu}(\\\\theta\\\\_M) &= \\\\int \\\\nu(\\\\theta\\\\_M \\\\mid \\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\text{SFT}}^{t\\\\_1}, \\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\text{SFT}}^{t\\\\_2}) \\\\, d\\\\theta\\\\_M \\\\\\\\ &\\\\times P(\\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\text{SFT}}^{t\\\\_1}) P(\\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\text{SFT}}^{t\\\\_2}), \\\\end{split} \\\\tag{6}$$\\n\\nwhere  $P\\\\_{\\\\nu}(\\\\theta\\\\_M)$  represents the probability distribution of the new model parameters  $\\\\theta\\\\_M$  generated through interpolation. The function  $\\\\nu(\\\\theta\\\\_M |$   $\\\\theta^{t\\\\_1}\\\\_{SFT}, \\\\theta^{t\\\\_2}\\\\_{SFT})$  defines the range and behavior of  $\\\\theta\\\\_M$ , depending on the interpolation strategy (such as linear interpolation). Additionally,  $P(\\\\theta^{t\\\\_1}\\\\_{SFT})$  and  $P(\\\\theta^{t\\\\_2}\\\\_{SFT})$  represent the prior distributions of the parameters of the two models, respectively.\\n\\nUnder the linear interpolation strategy, the function  $\\\\nu(\\\\theta\\\\_M | \\\\theta\\\\_{SFT}^{t\\\\_1}, \\\\theta\\\\_{SFT}^{t\\\\_2})$  is defined as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\theta\\\\_M = \\\\lambda\\\\_m \\\\cdot \\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\text{SFT}}^{t\\\\_1} + (1 - \\\\lambda\\\\_m) \\\\cdot \\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\text{SFT}}^{t\\\\_2}, \\\\qquad (7)\\n$$\\n\\nwhere\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup>\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup> is a method for merging language models by interpolating their parameters, enhancing their performance on various tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"SFT\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"SFT stands for Supervised Fine-Tuning, a process that adjusts language model parameters for specific tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Beta Distribution\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The Beta distribution is a statistical distribution used in M<sup>3</sup> to sample interpolation ratios between two fine-tuned models.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM)\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"VRM is a principle that introduces a vicinal distribution to enhance data diversity and model generalization.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup>\\\"<|>\\\"SFT\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup> utilizes SFT models to create a merged model by interpolating their parameters.\\\"<|>\\\"model merging, parameter adjustment\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup>\\\"<|>\\\"Beta Distribution\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup> employs the Beta distribution to determine the linear interpolation ratio for merging models.\\\"<|>\\\"statistical method, interpolation\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup>\\\"<|>\\\"Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM)\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup> extends the VRM principle by applying interpolation in the model parameter space for improved performance.\\\"<|>\\\"theoretical framework, model enhancement\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"model merging, fine-tuning, statistical methods, risk minimization, interpolation\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

Given two samples  $(xi, yi)$  and  $(xj, yj)$ , Mixup generates a new sample using the following formulas:\\n\\n$$\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\check{x} &= \\\\lambda x\\\\_i + (1 - \\\\lambda) x\\\\_j \\\\\\\\ \\\\check{y} &= \\\\lambda y\\\\_i + (1 - \\\\lambda) y\\\\_j \\\\end{aligned} \\\\tag{1}$$\\n\\n $\\\\tilde{x}$  and  $\\\\tilde{y}$  represent the generated synthetic sample and its label, respectively, with  $\\\\lambda$  determining their interpolation ratio, typically ranging from 0 to 1. Here,  $\\\\lambda$  is a hyperparameter sampled from a Beta distribution, i.e.,  $\\\\lambda \\\\sim Beta(\\\\alpha, \\\\alpha)$ , where  $\\\\alpha$  controls the strength of the interpolation between featuretarget pairs. Inspired by Mixup, we propose a novel model merging method, M<sup>3</sup>, which generates the parameters of the merged model by performing linear interpolation between the parameters of two fine-tuned LLMs, with the interpolation ratio being random.\\n\\n### 3 Methodology\\n\\n#### 3.1 Model Merging Problem\\n\\nFollowing [Yu et al.](#page-10-3) [\\\\(2024\\\\)](#page-10-3), we focus on merging fine-tuned LLMs that have been optimized from the same pre-trained backbone [\\\\(Touvron et al.,](#page-9-0) [2023\\\\)](#page-9-0). Specifically, we aim to fuse the parameters of these LLMs to create a unified model capable of handling multiple tasks. In this context, we restrict our attention to the merging of two models, as the mixup theory, which forms the basis of our approach, is generally applied to two entities.\\n\\nGiven two tasks  $t1$  and  $t2$  with the corresponding fine-tuned LLMs having parameters  $\\\\theta$ <sup>t1</sup>SFT and  $\\\\theta$ <sup>t2</sup>SFT, model merging aims to combine the parameters of these two models into a single model with parameters  $\\\\theta$ M. The resulting model should be able to effectively perform both tasks simultaneously, leveraging the knowledge learned from each individual model.\\n\\n#### 3.2 Mixup Model Merge\\n\\nInspired by Mixup [\\\\(Zhang,](#page-10-5) [2017\\\\)](#page-10-5), we propose a simple yet effective model merging method called Mixup Model Merge (M<sup>3</sup>). Unlike existing methods that use fixed merging ratios, M<sup>3</sup> generates the model contribution ratio randomly, harnessing randomness to inject fresh vitality into the model merging process. Specifically, M<sup>3</sup> further explores the parameter space of the merged model to unlock the potential of model merging.\\n\\nTo further elaborate, given two fine-tuned LLMs with parameters { $\\\\theta^{t\\\\_1}\\\\_{SFT}$ ,  $\\\\theta^{t\\\\_2}\\\\_{SFT}$ }, we combine M<sup>3</sup> with established model merging methods to fuse these parameters and obtain a single merged model with parameters  $\\\\theta\\\\_M$ . As illustrative examples, we consider two widely used merging methods: Average Merging [\\\\(Wortsman et al.,](#page-9-4) [2022\\\\)](#page-9-4) and Task Arithmetic [\\\\(Ilharco et al.,](#page-9-5) [2022\\\\)](#page-9-5).\\n\\nThe official computation process for Average Merging is described as follows:\\n\\n$$\\\\theta\\\\_M = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\text{SFT}}^{t\\\\_1} + \\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\text{SFT}}^{t\\\\_2} \\\\right) \\\\tag{2}$$\\n\\nThe official computation process for Task Arith-\\n\\nmetic is:\\n\\n$$\\\\begin{split} \\\\theta\\\\_M &= \\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\text{PRE}} + \\\\lambda \\\\cdot (\\\\delta^{t\\\\_1} + \\\\delta^{t\\\\_2}) \\\\\\\\ &= \\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\text{PRE}} + \\\\lambda \\\\cdot \\\\sum\\\\_{i=1}^{2} (\\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\text{SFT}}^{t\\\\_i} - \\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\text{PRE}}), \\\\end{split} \\\\tag{3}$$\\n\\nwhere  $\\\\theta\\\\_{PRE} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d$  represents the parameters of the pre-trained language model (PLM), such as Llama 2 [\\\\(Touvron et al.,](#page-9-0) [2023\\\\)](#page-9-0). λ is a scaling factor that weights the contribution of each model during the merging process.  $\\\\delta^{t\\\\_i}$  denotes the delta parameter [\\\\(Ilharco et al.,](#page-9-5) [2022\\\\)](#page-9-5), which is defined as the difference between the parameters of the language models (LMs) before and after SFT, i.e.,  $\\\\delta^t = \\\\theta^t\\\\_{SFT} - \\\\theta\\\\_{PRE} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d$ , where t refers to task t.\\n\\nWhen introducing M<sup>3</sup>, the process for Average Merging is reformulated as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\theta\\\\_M = \\\\lambda\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Mixup Model Merge\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Mixup Model Merge (M<sup>3</sup>) is a novel model merging method that combines parameters from two fine-tuned language models using random interpolation to enhance model performance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Fine-Tuned LLMs\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Fine-tuned LLMs are language models that have undergone additional training on specific tasks to improve their performance in those areas.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Average Merging\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Average Merging is an established model merging method that combines the parameters of two models by averaging them.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Task Arithmetic\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Task Arithmetic is a model merging technique that combines the parameters of pre-trained and fine-tuned models using a scaling factor and deltas.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Beta Distribution\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Beta Distribution is a probability distribution used in statistics to model the behavior of random variables limited to a range of values.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Llama 2\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Llama 2 is a pre-trained language model that serves as a backbone for model merging processes.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Hyperparameter\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Hyperparameters are configuration settings used to control the learning process of machine learning algorithms, such as the interpolation ratio in Mixup.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Mixup Model Merge\\\"<|>\\\"Fine-Tuned LLMs\\\"<|>\\\"Mixup Model Merge (M<sup>3</sup>) utilizes fine-tuned LLMs as the basis for its parameter merging process.\\\"<|>\\\"model merging, machine learning\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Mixup Model Merge\\\"<|>\\\"Average Merging\\\"<|>\\\"Mixup Model Merge incorporates concepts from Average Merging to enhance its model fusion approach.\\\"<|>\\\"model merging techniques, innovation\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Mixup Model Merge\\\"<|>\\\"Task Arithmetic\\\"<|>\\\"Mixup Model Merge builds upon Task Arithmetic by introducing randomness in the merging process.\\\"<|>\\\"model merging methods, randomness\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Fine-Tuned LLMs\\\"<|>\\\"Llama 2\\\"<|>\\\"Fine-tuned LLMs often utilize Llama 2 as their underlying architecture to improve task performance.\\\"<|>\\\"model architecture, performance enhancement\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Beta Distribution\\\"<|>\\\"Hyperparameter\\\"<|>\\\"The interpolation ratio in Mixup is determined by a hyperparameter sampled from a Beta distribution, influencing the model merging process.\\\"<|>\\\"statistical modeling, machine learning\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"model merging, machine learning, parameter optimization, statistical methods\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

For more details on PromptBench and attack methods, please refer to Appendix [A.4.](#page-12-0)\\n\\nEvaluation Metrics We calculate win rate for AlpacaEval and LiveBench-Instruction, zeroshot accuracy for GSM8K and MATH, pass@1 for HumanEval, MBPP and LiveBench-Coding, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for CoLA, accuracy for SST2, and zero-shot accuracy for LiveBench-TypoFixing.\\n\\nImplementation Details Unless otherwise specified, the details of the model merging experiments are consistent with [Yu et al.](#page-10-3) [\\\\(2024\\\\)](#page-10-3). The hyperparameter  $\\\\alpha$  for M<sup>3</sup> is chosen from the range [0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5]. For a detailed description of the hyperparameter settings in model merging methods, please refer to Appendix [A.2.](#page-11-1) Additionally, all experiments are conducted on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs.\\n\\n#### 4.2 Merging Task-Specific Fine-Tuned LLMs\\n\\nWe integrate M<sup>3</sup> into three prominent model merging techniques: Average Merging, Task Arithmetic, and TIES-Merging. The performance of merging task-specific fine-tuned LLMs is presented in Table [1.](#page-6-0)\\n\\nFrom Table [1,](#page-6-0) we obtain the following observations: 1) M<sup>3</sup> generally enhances Average Merging, Task Arithmetic, and TIES-Merging when merging fine-tuned LLMs. For example, the improvements achieved by Average Merging with M<sup>3</sup> for Math & Code are 7.43% on GSM8K, 3.74% on Math, and 11.0% on MBPP. For LM & Code, Average Merging with M<sup>3</sup> shows improvements of 7.31% on AlpacaEval, 7.32% on HumanEval, and 2.4% on MBPP. Task Arithmetic with M<sup>3</sup> results in improvements of 2.0% on AlpacaEval and 2.44% on HumanEval for LM & Code, and 10.4% on MBPP for Math & Code. TIES-Merging with M<sup>3</sup> achieves an improvement of 4.01% for LM & Math on GSM8K. For LM & Code, TIES-Merging with M<sup>3</sup> shows significant improvements of 3.11% on AlpacaEval, 25.61% on HumanEval, and 30.8% on MBPP. 2) Compared to Task Arithmetic, Average Merging and TIES-Merging tend to benefit more from M<sup>3</sup>. This is because both Average Merging and TIES-Merging use a fixed merging ratio of 1/2, whereas Task Arithmetic allows the merging ratio to vary within the range [0.5, 1.0]. Consequently, the randomness introduced by M<sup>3</sup> in the merging ratio has a more pronounced impact on Average Merging. This further highlights the critical role of an effective merging ratio in determining the performance of the merged model. 3) [Yu et al.](#page-10-3) [\\\\(2024\\\\)](#page-10-3) has indicated that the suboptimal results of merging WizardMath-13B with llama-2-13b-codealpaca are due\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Austin et al.\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Austin et al. is referenced in the context of evaluating large language models (LLMs) and their datasets.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"White et al.\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"White et al. is mentioned with respect to the LiveBench framework for evaluating out-of-distribution robustness.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Zhu et al.\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Zhu et al. is noted for their work on the PromptBench module used for assessing LLMs against adversarial prompts.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"GSM8K\\\"<|>\\\"dataset\\\"<|>\\\"GSM8K is a dataset used for evaluating zero-shot accuracy in mathematical problem-solving tasks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MATH\\\"<|>\\\"dataset\\\"<|>\\\"MATH is a dataset utilized to evaluate the performance of LLMs in solving mathematical problems.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"SST2\\\"<|>\\\"dataset\\\"<|>\\\"SST2 is a sentiment analysis dataset referenced for evaluating accuracy in LLMs.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"CoLA\\\"<|>\\\"dataset\\\"<|>\\\"CoLA is a dataset used to assess grammatical correctness in language models.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090\\\"<|>\\\"equipment\\\"<|>\\\"NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 is a high-performance GPU utilized for conducting experiments in LLM model merging.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup>\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup> is a model merging technique integrated into various merging strategies for fine-tuned LLMs.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Average Merging\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Average Merging is one of the merging techniques evaluated for enhancing the performance of LLMs.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Task Arithmetic\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Task Arithmetic is a merging technique that allows varying merging ratios to improve LLM performance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging is a merging technique that has shown significant improvements in performance for LLMs.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Austin et al.\\\"<|>\\\"White et al.\\\"<|>\\\"Austin et al. and White et al. are both involved in the evaluation of LLMs and their datasets, indicating collaboration or related research.\\\"|<|>\\\"research collaboration, evaluation\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Zhu et al.\\\"<|>\\\"PromptBench\\\"<|>\\\"Zhu et al. developed the Adversarial Prompt Attacks module within PromptBench, linking their research directly to the evaluation of LLMs.\\\"|<|>\\\"development, evaluation\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup>\\\"<|>\\\"Average Merging\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup> is integrated into Average Merging to enhance the performance of merging fine-tuned LLMs.\\\"|<|>\\\"model merging, performance improvement\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup>\\\"<|>\\\"Task Arithmetic\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup> shows improvements in Task Arithmetic when merging fine-tuned LLMs, indicating its effectiveness in this context.\\\"|<|>\\\"model merging, performance enhancement\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup>\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup> is utilized in TIES-Merging, leading to significant performance gains in LLMs.\\\"|<|>\\\"model merging, performance improvement\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"LLMs, model merging, evaluation metrics, adversarial robustness, datasets\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

\\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\text{SFT}}^{t\\\\_1} + (1 - \\\\lambda\\\\_m) \\\\cdot \\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\text{SFT}}^{t\\\\_2}, \\\\qquad (7)\\n$$\\n\\nwhere  $\\\\lambda\\\\_m \\\\in (0, 1)$  is the interpolation ratio. The corresponding distribution  $P\\\\_{\\\\nu}(\\\\theta\\\\_M)$  is expressed as:\\n\\n$$P\\\\_{\\\\nu}(\\\\theta\\\\_M) = \\\\int \\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\_M - \\\\left(\\\\lambda\\\\_m \\\\cdot \\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\rm SFT}^{t\\\\_1} + (1 - \\\\lambda\\\\_m) \\\\cdot \\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\rm SFT}^{t\\\\_2}\\\\right)\\\\right) P(\\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\rm SFT}^{t\\\\_1}) P(\\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\rm SFT}^{t\\\\_2}) d\\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\rm SFT}^{t\\\\_1} d\\\\theta\\\\_{\\\\rm SFT}^{t\\\\_2},$$\\n\\n$$(8)$$\\n\\nwhere  $\\\\delta(\\\\cdot)$  is the Dirac delta function, ensuring that  $\\\\theta\\\\_M$  satisfies the linear interpolation rule. By using this linear interpolation method, the parameters  $\\\\theta\\\\_{SFT}^{t\\\\_1}$  and  $\\\\theta\\\\_{SFT}^{t\\\\_2}$  are combined in the parameter space, forming a new neighborhood distribution  $P\\\\_{\\\\nu}(\\\\theta\\\\_M)$ . This process effectively merges the knowledge of both models into a unified parameter space, thus achieving robust performance across different tasks while maintaining the original strengths of the models.\\n\\nBy interpolating the parameters, M<sup>3</sup> encourages the model to learn smoother decision boundaries. In this context, smoother decision boundaries can be understood as the boundaries between different tasks, such as instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation, where the model must understand and adapt to each task differently. In tasks  $t\\\\_1$  and  $t\\\\_2$ , M<sup>3</sup> creates a virtual neighborhood that seamlessly integrates knowledge from both tasks. This approach prevents the merged model from overfitting task-specific details, ensuring a balanced and effective performance across all tasks.\\n\\nSecondly, M<sup>3</sup> introduces a linear inductive bias in the parameter space, encouraging the merged model parameters to lie on a linear manifold between the two source models. This linear structure offers significant advantages in terms of simplicity and generalization. According to Occam's Razor, simpler solutions tend to generalize better. By performing linear interpolation between two sets of parameters, M<sup>3</sup> avoids unnecessary complexity in the model merging process, leading to a more straightforward and efficient solution.\\n\\nThirdly, M<sup>3</sup> can improve the performance of the merged model across multiple tasks by mitigating task conflicts. Different tasks may require conflicting parameter values, which can lead to performance degradation on one task while optimizing for another. Linear interpolation helps balance these conflicts, resulting in a model that performs well among all tasks.\\n\\n### 4 Experiments\\n\\n#### 4.1 Experimental Setup\\n\\nTask-Specific Fine-Tuned LLMs and Datasets Following the experimental setup given in [Yu](#page-10-3) [et al.](#page-10-3) [\\\\(2024\\\\)](#page-10-3), we select three task-specific finetuned LLMs: WizardLM-13B [\\\\(Xu et al.,](#page-10-7) [2024\\\\)](#page-10-7), WizardMath-13B [\\\\(Luo et al.,](#page-9-9) [2023\\\\)](#page-9-9), and llama-2- 13b-code-alpaca [\\\\(Chaudhary,](#page-8-8) [2023\\\\)](#page-8-8), all of which\\n\\nuse Llama-2-13b [\\\\(Touvron et al.,](#page-9-0) [2023\\\\)](#page-9-0) as the pretrained backbone.

and CoLA Datasets when Executing StressTest prompt attack method. The best and secondbest results are marked in bold and underlined fonts.\\n\\nby 15.75% on CoLA. Furthermore, in most cases, M<sup>3</sup> not only improves the adversarial robustness of the merged models but also enhances their performance metrics (accuracy and MCC) on the SST2 and CoLA datasets. Specifically, with M<sup>3</sup>, Math & Code demonstrates a 28.56% increase in accuracy on SST2 and a 26.18% increase in MCC on CoLA, while LM & Code achieves a 62.62% increase in accuracy on SST2. These results show that M<sup>3</sup> effectively enhances both the adversarial robustness and the performance of the merged models in sentiment analysis and grammar correctness tasks. Detailed experimental results for the remaining Prompt Attack Methods (DeepWordBug and BERTAttack) are presented in Appendix [B.](#page-12-1)\\n\\n#### 4.4 Mixup Model Merge with DARE\\n\\nDARE is a model sparsification method proposed by [\\\\(Yu et al.,](#page-10-3) [2024\\\\)](#page-10-3), with a more detailed introduction provided in Appendix [E.](#page-14-1) We combine M<sup>3</sup> and DARE with three model merging techniques, including Average Merging, Task Arithmetic, and TIES-Merging, to compare the effects of M<sup>3</sup> and DARE individually and explore their combined impact. The experimental results are presented in Table [1.](#page-6-0) Additionally, in the DARE method, the drop rate hyperparameter is set to 0.2.\\n\\nFrom Table [1,](#page-6-0) we conclude that: 1) In most cases,\\n\\nM<sup>3</sup> outperforms DARE, with a particularly significant advantage on certain datasets. For instance, the Math & Code model achieves a pass@1 score of 9.8% on the MBPP dataset when combined with DARE, while this score increases to 19% when combined with M<sup>3</sup>. This demonstrates that M<sup>3</sup> unlocks new potential in model merging by randomly generating merging ratios, leading to performance improvements that surpass those achieved by DARE. 2) Combining DARE and M<sup>3</sup> generally results in better model merging performance. For example, the LM & Math and LM & Code models, enhanced by TIES-Merging with M<sup>3</sup> and DARE, achieve the best performance on the test datasets. While only incorporating TIES-Merging with M<sup>3</sup> to these models, the enhanced models achieve the second best performance. This suggests that M<sup>3</sup> and DARE can complement each other. Moreover, in some cases, M<sup>3</sup> alone can deliver the best results, while DARE alone only achieves the best performance in very few cases, further demonstrating the superiority of M<sup>3</sup>.\\n\\n### 5 Conclusion\\n\\nInspired by the mixup method and the Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) principle, we propose Mixup Model Merge (M<sup>3</sup>), a novel approach for merging fine-tuned LLMs by introducing randomness into the parameters linear interpolation process. Unlike traditional methods such as average merging and task arithmetic, M<sup>3</sup> leverages a Beta distribution to dynamically adjust the merging ratio, enabling more flexible exploration of the parameter space. Experimental results demonstrate that M<sup>3</sup> not only significantly enhances the performance of the merged model across various tasks but also improves its OOD and adversarial robustness. Furthermore, when combined with sparsification techniques such as DARE, our approach achieves even more favorable model merging outcomes. In summary, M<sup>3</sup> is a simple yet powerful technique that requires minimal computational resources. By merely adjusting the merging ratio, it produces a merged model with enhanced task-specific capabilities and robustness. This exciting discovery paves the way for further research into optimizing merging ratio selection in model merging processes.\\n\\n### 6 Limitations\\n\\nThere are several limitations of the M<sup>3</sup> method: While it performs well for merging two models, (1) its scalability when merging a larger number of models, especially those with significant differences, remains uncertain. Additionally, (2) due to the inherent randomness in the merging process, multiple attempts may be required to achieve a merged model that meets expectations. This unpredictability can lead to increased computational costs, particularly in large-scale applications, resulting in a significant rise in resource consumption. Finally, (3) Our method may also be extended to a wider range of applications, such as merging fine-tuned models with Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) [\\\\(Ouyang et al.,](#page-9-20) [2022\\\\)](#page-9-20) models to reduce the alignment tax [\\\\(FINE-](#page-8-17)[TUNING\\\\)](#page-8-17).\\n\\n### References\\n\\n- <span id=\\\"\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup>\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup> is a novel approach for merging fine-tuned language models, enhancing performance through dynamic parameter adjustment.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DARE\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"DARE is a model sparsification method that works in conjunction with M<sup>3</sup> to improve model merging performance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Math & Code\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Math & Code is a model that demonstrated significant performance improvements when combined with M<sup>3</sup> in model merging.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"LM & Code\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"LM & Code is another model that achieved notable accuracy increases when enhanced with M<sup>3</sup> during merging.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"SST2\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"SST2 is a dataset used for evaluating sentiment analysis models, referenced in the context of model performance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"CoLA\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"CoLA is a dataset that tests grammar correctness, mentioned in relation to model performance metrics.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MBPP\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"MBPP is a dataset where the Math & Code model achieved a specific score when combined with DARE.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Model Merging Techniques\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Model merging techniques include Average Merging, Task Arithmetic, and TIES-Merging, which are evaluated for their effectiveness.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup>\\\"<|>\\\"DARE\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup> and DARE are combined to explore their effects on model merging performance.\\\"<|>\\\"model enhancement, performance improvement\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Math & Code\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup>\\\"<|>\\\"The Math & Code model achieves significant performance improvements when merged with M<sup>3</sup>.\\\"<|>\\\"model performance, merging technique\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"LM & Code\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup>\\\"<|>\\\"LM & Code sees notable accuracy increases when enhanced with M<sup>3</sup> during merging.\\\"<|>\\\"model performance, merging technique\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"SST2\\\"<|>\\\"Math & Code\\\"<|>\\\"The performance of Math & Code is evaluated using the SST2 dataset, showing improvements with M<sup>3</sup>.\\\"<|>\\\"dataset evaluation, sentiment analysis\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"CoLA\\\"<|>\\\"Math & Code\\\"<|>\\\"Math & Code's performance metrics are assessed using the CoLA dataset, highlighting improvements with M<sup>3</sup>.\\\"<|>\\\"dataset evaluation, grammar correctness\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"MBPP\\\"<|>\\\"Math & Code\\\"<|>\\\"Math & Code achieves specific performance scores on the MBPP dataset when merged with DARE.\\\"<|>\\\"dataset performance, model evaluation\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"model merging, performance enhancement, sentiment analysis, grammar correctness, machine learning\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

This further highlights the critical role of an effective merging ratio in determining the performance of the merged model. 3) [Yu et al.](#page-10-3) [\\\\(2024\\\\)](#page-10-3) has indicated that the suboptimal results of merging WizardMath-13B with llama-2-13b-codealpaca are due to llama-2-13b-code-alpaca not being well fine-tuned for code generation. In this context, the proposed M<sup>3</sup> approach improves the pass@1 score on MBPP by 10.4% for the merged model of WizardMath-13B and llama-2-13b-codealpaca. The improvement demonstrates that when one of the fine-tuned models to be merged is not well fine-tuned for the specific task, M<sup>3</sup> can effectively unlock the potential of both models, maximizing the performance of the merged model. The M<sup>3</sup> approach helps mitigate the impact of suboptimal fine-tuning on model merging performance.\\n\\n#### 4.3 Model Robustness\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-5-0\\\"></span>![](_page_5_Figure_4.jpeg)\\n\\nFigure 4: Performance of merged models (Math & Code, LM & Math, and LM & Code) using three model merging methods (Average Merging, Task Arithmetic, and TIES-Merging) on OOD datasets.\\n\\nOut-of-distribution robustness To ensure that the evaluation datasets are as representative as possible of OOD data, we select datasets with sufficiently recent release dates and ensure they cover domains that fine-tuned LLMs have not been specifically trained on. Consequently, Math & Code is evaluated on LiveBench-Instruction, LM & Math on LiveBench-Coding, and LM & Code on LiveBench-TypoFixing. The performance of the merged LLMs is shown in Figure [4.](#page-5-0) As illustrated in Figure [4,](#page-5-0) M<sup>3</sup> consistently enhances the performance of merged models—Math & Code, LM & Math, and LM & Code—on OOD datasets.

Finally, when TIES-Merging is applied alongside M<sup>3</sup>, the Math & Code model achieves a 1.1% improvement in win rate on LiveBench-Instruction, the LM & Math model records a 0.6% increase in pass@1 on LiveBench-Coding, and the LM & Code model demonstrates a remarkable 14% improvement in accuracy on LiveBench-TypoFixing. These results underscore the robustness and versatility of M<sup>3</sup> in enhancing model performance across diverse merging strategies and OOD tasks.\\n\\nAdversarial robustness We employ three Prompt Attack Methods supported by the promptbench codebase (DeepWordBug, BERTAttack, and StressTest) [\\\\(Zhu et al.,](#page-10-8) [2024\\\\)](#page-10-8) to evaluate the adversarial robustness of three merged models\\n\\n(Math & Code, LM & Math, and LM & Code) obtained through the task arithmetic method. To balance experimental effectiveness with computational efficiency, we randomly selected the positions of the three attacked words in the prompts when executing the DeepWordBug and BERTAttack attacks. Adversarial robustness is assessed using the Performance Drop Rate (PDR) [\\\\(Zhu et al.,](#page-10-6) [2023\\\\)](#page-10-6), where a lower PDR indicates stronger robustness. Further details on PDR can be found in Appendix [D.](#page-14-0) The performance of the merged LLMs is shown in Table [2.](#page-7-0)\\n\\nAs shown in Table [2,](#page-7-0) M<sup>3</sup> improves the adversarial robustness of the merged models in most cases with the StressTest Prompt Attack Method. For example, with M<sup>3</sup>, the PDR of Math & Code decreased by 3.2% on the SST2 dataset and by 92.12% on the CoLA dataset, while the PDR of LM & Code decreased by 30.36% on SST2 and\\n\\n<span

Out-of-Distribution Dataset Selection Details\\n\\nLiveBench [\\\\(White et al.,](#page-9-10) [2024\\\\)](#page-9-10) is a dynamic benchmark for large language models, featuring frequently updated questions and diverse tasks. To assess OOD robustness, we evaluate math & code, LM & math, and LM & code models using instruction following (LiveBench-Instruction), coding (LiveBench-Coding), and language comprehension (LiveBench-TypoFixing) category in LiveBench, respectively, deliberately avoiding the fine-tuning domains of the merged fine-tuned models. These tasks were released after November 2023, whereas WizardLM-13B, WizardMath-13B, and llama-2- 13b-code-alpaca were all introduced earlier. Furthermore, their shared Llama-2-13b backbone was trained on data only up to July 2023. Consequently, these factors collectively ensure that the evaluation remains OOD in the temporal dimension.\\n\\nWhen assessing the OOD robustness of LM & Code using the Language Comprehension category in LiveBench, only the typo-fixing task is considered. This decision is based on the fact that LiveBench is highly challenging, and the merged model performs poorly on other tasks in this category, with accuracy close to zero, rendering the evaluation results inconclusive and uninformative.\\n\\nFinally, we acknowledge the limitations of these datasets. For large models like Llama-2-13b, identifying truly OOD datasets is difficult, as their training data likely covers similar distributions. These datasets are better described as \\\"out-of-example\\\", representing instances not explicitly seen during training. As discussed in [\\\\(Wang et al.,](#page-9-8) [2023\\\\)](#page-9-8), distribution shifts can occur across domains and time. While Llama-2-13b may have been trained on datasets for tasks like instruction-following, coding, and language comprehension, the datasets we selected remain valuable for OOD evaluation by capturing temporal shifts, providing insights into robustness over time.\\n\\n### <span id=\\\"page-12-0\\\"></span>A.4 Adversarial Robustness Evaluation Experiments Setting Details\\n\\nPromptBench [\\\\(Zhu et al.,](#page-10-8) [2024\\\\)](#page-10-8) is a unified library designed for evaluating LLMs, providing a standardized and extensible framework. It includes several key components such as prompt construction, prompt engineering, dataset and model loading, adversarial prompt attacks, dynamic evaluation protocols, and analysis tools.\\n\\nWe use the Adversarial Prompt Attacks module in PromptBench aims to evaluate the robustness of LLMs against adversarial prompts. We employ three methods to perform adversarial attacks on prompts to evaluate the adversarial robustness of the merged models: DeepWordBug [\\\\(Gao et al.,](#page-8-16) [2018\\\\)](#page-8-16), BERTAttack [\\\\(Li et al.,](#page-9-16) [2020\\\\)](#page-9-16), and StressTest [\\\\(Naik et al.,](#page-9-17) [2018\\\\)](#page-9-17), representing Character-level, Word-level, and Sentence-level attacks, respectively.\\n\\n- DeepWordBug introduces subtle characterlevel perturbations (e.g., adding, deleting, or replacing characters) to words in text to deceive language models. It aims to evaluate a model's robustness against small typographical errors that may alter the model's performance without being easily detected.\\n- BERTAttack manipulates text at the word level by replacing words with contextually similar synonyms to mislead large language models. This method tests the model's ability to maintain accuracy despite small lexical changes that might alter the meaning of the input.\\n- StressTest appends irrelevant or redundant sentences to the end of a prompt to distract\\n\\n<span id=\\\"page-12-2\\\"></span>![](_page_12_Figure_7.jpeg)\\n\\nMerged Task Vector For task vectors within the dashed box, apply randomized linear interpolation to determine the final parameter value.\\n\\nTask Vector of Merged LLM\\n\\nTask Vector of LLM 1 Parameter\\n\\nInfluential values\\n\\nTask Vector of LLM 2\\n\\nThe values that align with the elected sign\\n\\nTask Vector of LLM 1 Parameter Task Vector of LLM 2 Task Vector of Merged LLM Influential values (b) After introducing M<sup>3</sup>, the Disjoint Merge step in the TIES-\\n\\nThe values that align with the elected sign\\n\\nMerging procedure.\\n\\n2.Elect the sign for 3.Disjoint Merge Merged\\nnal TIES-Merging is that, in the Disjoint Merge step, Take their mean Figure 5: The difference between M<sup>3</sup> and the origiwhen two task vectors are retained for a given parameter, the mean of the task vectors is replaced by a random linear interpolation, while the other operations remain unchanged.\\n\\n> and confuse language models.

Integrating M<sup>3</sup> into the TIES-Merging Model Merging Method\\n\\nFigure [5](#page-12-2) shows the specific implementation approach to incorporating M<sup>3</sup> into TIES-Merging. After the steps of trimming parameters with lower magnitudes and resolving sign disagreements, the\\n\\ntwo models to be merged are denoted as M<sup>1</sup> and M2. During the M<sup>3</sup> process, only the parameters that are preserved in both M<sup>1</sup> and M2 are interpolated according to the model merging hyperparameter  $\\\\lambda\\\\_m$  to obtain the merged parameters. For parameters that are preserved in only one of the models, no interpolation is performed, and the original value from the preserved model is retained in the merged model.\\n\\n## <span id=\\\"page-14-0\\\"></span>D Performance Drop Rate (PDR) for Adversarial Robustness\\n\\nThe adversarial robustness is evaluated using the Performance Drop Rate (PDR) [\\\\(Zhu et al.,](#page-10-6) [2023\\\\)](#page-10-6), which is defined as follows:\\n\\n$$\\\\text{PDR} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Metric}\\\\_{\\\\text{no attack}} - \\\\text{Metric}\\\\_{\\\\text{attack}}}{\\\\text{Metric}\\\\_{\\\\text{no attack}}},\\\\quad(9)$$\\n\\nwhere Metricno attack denotes the performance metric without any prompt attack, and Metricattack represents the performance metric under the prompt attack. A smaller PDR indicates stronger adversarial defense against prompt attacks, implying better adversarial robustness.\\n\\n### <span id=\\\"page-14-1\\\"></span>E Detailed Introduction to DARE\\n\\nDARE (Drop And REscale) [\\\\(Yu et al.,](#page-10-3) [2024\\\\)](#page-10-3) is a model sparsification method designed to reduce the redundancy of delta parameters in fine-tuned models while preserving their task-specific capabilities. In SFT, model parameters are optimized to unlock abilities for specific tasks, with the difference between fine-tuned and pre-trained parameters referred to as delta parameters.\\n\\nHowever, studies have shown that delta parameters are often highly redundant. DARE addresses this redundancy by randomly dropping a proportion  $p$  of delta parameters (referred to as the drop rate) and rescaling the remaining ones by a factor of  $1/(1 - p)$ . This simple yet effective approach enables DARE to eliminate up to 99% of delta parameters with minimal impact on model performance, particularly in large-scale models, and it can be applied using only CPUs.\\n\\nBeyond sparsification, DARE serves as a versatile plug-in for merging multiple homologous fine-tuned models (fine-tuned from the same base model) by reducing parameter interference. When combined with existing model merging techniques such as Average Merging, Task Arithmetic, and\\n\\nTIES-Merging, DARE facilitates the fusion of models while retaining or even enhancing task performance across multiple benchmarks. This effect is especially pronounced in decoder-based LMs, where DARE boosts task\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"CoLA\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability) is a dataset used for evaluating the linguistic acceptability of sentences.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"SST2\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"SST2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank 2) is a dataset used for sentiment analysis in natural language processing.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"BERTAttack\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"BERTAttack is a method used to evaluate the adversarial robustness of models by applying prompt attacks.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup>\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup> refers to a model merging technique that integrates multiple models to enhance performance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging is a model merging method that facilitates the integration of different models while maintaining their capabilities.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"DARE\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"DARE (Drop And REscale) is a model sparsification method designed to reduce redundancy in model parameters while preserving task capabilities.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Performance Drop Rate (PDR)\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Performance Drop Rate (PDR) is a metric used to evaluate the adversarial robustness of models under attack.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"CoLA\\\"<|>\\\"SST2\\\"<|>\\\"CoLA and SST2 are both datasets used in natural language processing for different purposes, with CoLA focusing on linguistic acceptability and SST2 on sentiment analysis.\\\"<|>\\\"dataset comparison, NLP evaluation\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"BERTAttack\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup>\\\"<|>\\\"BERTAttack is utilized in the context of evaluating models that may be merged using the M<sup>3</sup> technique, highlighting its relevance in adversarial robustness studies.\\\"<|>\\\"adversarial evaluation, model merging\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup>\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging\\\"<|>\\\"M<sup>3</sup> is an approach that can be integrated into the TIES-Merging framework for improved model performance during merging.\\\"<|>\\\"model integration, performance enhancement\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"DARE\\\"<|>\\\"TIES-Merging\\\"<|>\\\"DARE complements TIES-Merging by reducing parameter interference during the merging of models, enhancing overall task performance.\\\"<|>\\\"sparsification, model performance\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Performance Drop Rate (PDR)\\\"<|>\\\"BERTAttack\\\"<|>\\\"Performance Drop Rate (PDR) is a metric evaluated through the BERTAttack method to assess model robustness against adversarial attacks.\\\"<|>\\\"evaluation metric, adversarial robustness\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"adversarial robustness, model merging, natural language processing, datasets, evaluation metrics\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

The model undergoes supervised fine-tuning with AI-generated data, followed by refinement via RLHF. Evaluation results show that Evol-Instruct-generated instructions outperform human-written ones, and WizardLM-13B surpasses ChatGPT in high-complexity tasks. In GPT-4 automated evaluation, it achieves over 90% of ChatGPT's performance in 17 out of 29 tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of AI-evolved instruction fine-tuning [\\\\(Xu et al.,](#page-10-7) [2024\\\\)](#page-10-7).\\n\\n- WizardMath-13B, optimized from Llama-2- 13b, is designed for mathematical reasoning and enhances Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [\\\\(Wei](#page-9-21) [et al.,](#page-9-21) [2022\\\\)](#page-9-21) capabilities. It uses Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback to evolve math tasks and improve reasoning. Trained on GSM8K and MATH datasets, it excels in both basic and advanced math problems. In evaluations, WizardMath-Mistral 7B outperforms all open-source models with fewer training data, while WizardMath 70B surpasses GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude 2, and even early GPT-4 versions in mathematical

When combined with existing model merging techniques such as Average Merging, Task Arithmetic, and\\n\\nTIES-Merging, DARE facilitates the fusion of models while retaining or even enhancing task performance across multiple benchmarks. This effect is especially pronounced in decoder-based LMs, where DARE boosts task generalization.\\n\\nExperiments on AlpacaEval, GSM8K, and MBPP reveal that the merged LM has the potential to outperform any individual source LM, presenting a significant new discovery.

Steps---\n\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name.\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,category]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\nFormat the content-level key words as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n5.

The sections should:   Introduce the idea of categorizing model merging methods.   Describe the category it belongs to and make each category as sub paragraphs and name the category with subsection. For each category, briefly explain the core idea, motivation, and include well-known examples or papers (with in-text citations in the format: (Author et al., Year)).   Ensure the tone is formal and academic, suitable for a peer-reviewed conference paper.  Write in paragraph form (no bullet points).    At the end, include a list of all cited references in standard BibTeX or IEEE format which I can take and include in the .bib file.   Always include Sources with the document in knowledge as reference."
